We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS\n","whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs. The new\n","features studied, often required in practical applications, can be summarized\n","in three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological\n","language, called ALCNR, including general complements of concepts, number\n","restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion\n","statements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular\n","case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction\n","services (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a\n","sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge\n","bases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems.

In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter\n","binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other\n","circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it\n","is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the\n","contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R\n","programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is\n","compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe\n","some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and\n","actual mobile robots.\n","Learning the past tense of English verbs - a seemingly minor aspect of\n","language acquisition - has generated heated debates since 1986, and has become\n","a landmark task for testing the adequacy of cognitive modeling.

In this paper, we present a\n","general-purpose Symbolic Pattern Associator (SPA) based upon the decision-tree\n","learning algorithm ID3. We conduct extensive head-to-head comparisons on the\n","generalization ability between ANN models and the SPA under different\n","representations. We conclude that the SPA generalizes the past tense of unseen\n","verbs better than ANN models by a wide margin, and we offer insights as to why\n","this should be the case. We also discuss a new default strategy for\n","decision-tree learning algorithms.\n","The ability to identify interesting and repetitive substructures is an\n","essential component to discovering knowledge in structural data. We describe a\n","new version of our SUBDUE substructure discovery system based on the minimum\n","description length principle. The SUBDUE system discovers substructures that\n","compress the original data and represent structural concepts in the data. By\n","replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of\n","SUBDUE produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the\n","data. SUBDUE uses a computationally-bounded inexact graph match that identifies\n","similar, but not identical, instances of a substructure and finds an\n","approximate measure of closeness of two substructures when under computational\n","constraints. In addition to the minimum description length principle, other\n","background knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more\n","appropriate substructures.

In this paper we present our approach to the theory revision\n","problem for propositional domain theories. The approach described here, called\n","PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to numerically\n","track the ``flow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the\n","precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or\n","undesired) derivation for a given example. This information is used to\n","efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory. PTR is proved to\n","converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown\n","experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories.\n","We report on a series of experiments in which all decision trees consistent\n","with the training data are constructed. These experiments were run to gain an\n","understanding of the properties of the set of consistent decision trees and the\n","factors that affect the accuracy of individual trees. In particular, we\n","investigated the relationship between the size of a decision tree consistent\n","with some training data and the accuracy of the tree on test data. The\n","experiments were performed on a massively parallel Maspar computer. The results\n","of the experiments on several artificial and two real world problems indicate\n","that, for many of the problems investigated, smaller consistent decision trees\n","are on average less accurate than the average accuracy of slightly larger\n","trees.\n","This paper analyzes the correctness of the subsumption algorithm used in\n","CLASSIC, a description logic-based knowledge representation system that is\n","being used in practical applications.

The soundness and completeness of the\n","polynomial-time subsumption algorithm is established using description graphs,\n","which are an abstracted version of the implementation structures used in\n","CLASSIC, and are of independent interest.\n","In this paper we describe how to modify GSAT so that it can be applied to\n","non-clausal formulas. The idea is to use a particular ``score'' function which\n","gives the number of clauses of the CNF conversion of a formula which are false\n","under a given truth assignment. Its value is computed in linear time, without\n","constructing the CNF conversion itself. The proposed methodology applies to\n","most of the variants of GSAT proposed so far.\n","Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we\n","consider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a\n","degree of belief that some formula Phi holds given KB. If we are reasoning\n","about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all\n","possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB,\n","and compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of\n","belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show\n","that when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary\n","predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N\n","grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can\n","use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result\n","is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence,\n","but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the\n","limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates\n","seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the\n","connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These\n","observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of\n","maximum-entropy methods.\n","Information extraction is the task of automatically picking up information of\n","interest from an unconstrained text. Information of interest is usually\n","extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant\n","pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse\n","processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the\n","first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing\n","any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can\n","achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to\n","understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information.\n","Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly\n","because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other\n","pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a\n","structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper\n","reports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information\n","using a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high\n","level of system performance which approaches human performance.\n","This article describes a new system for induction of oblique decision trees.\n","This system, OC1, combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of\n","randomization to find a good oblique split (in the form of a hyperplane) at\n","each node of a decision tree. Oblique decision tree methods are tuned\n","especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can\n","be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present\n","extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze\n","OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate\n","than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of\n","randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees.\n","This paper introduces a framework for Planning while Learning where an agent\n","is given a goal to achieve in an environment whose behavior is only partially\n","known to the agent. We discuss the tractability of various plan-design\n","processes. We show that for a large natural class of Planning while Learning\n","systems, a plan can be presented and verified in a reasonable time. However,\n","coming up algorithmically with a plan, even for simple classes of systems is\n","apparently intractable. We emphasize the role of off-line plan-design\n","processes, and show that, in most natural cases, the verification (projection)\n","part can be carried out in an efficient algorithmic manner.\n","The vast amounts of on-line text now available have led to renewed interest\n","in information extraction (IE) systems that analyze unrestricted text,\n","producing a structured representation of selected information from the text.\n","This paper presents a novel approach that uses machine learning to acquire\n","knowledge for some of the higher level IE processing. Wrap-Up is a trainable IE\n","discourse component that makes intersentential inferences and identifies\n","logical relations among information extracted from the text. Previous\n","corpus-based approaches were limited to lower level processing such as\n","part-of-speech tagging, lexical disambiguation, and dictionary construction.\n","Wrap-Up is fully trainable, and not only automatically decides what classifiers\n","are needed, but even derives the feature set for each classifier automatically.\n","Performance equals that of a partially trainable discourse module requiring\n","manual customization for each domain.\n","This paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning\n","from a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models\n","include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and\n","undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are\n","extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of\n","plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are\n","provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of\n","probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas\n","for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the\n","expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some\n","popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This\n","includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks,\n","and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper\n","concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how\n","some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original\n","contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that\n","graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex\n","learning algorithms.\n","For many years, the intuitions underlying partial-order planning were largely\n","taken for granted. Only in the past few years has there been renewed interest\n","in the fundamental principles underlying this paradigm. In this paper, we\n","present a rigorous comparative analysis of partial-order and total-order\n","planning by focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared. We\n","show that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread\n","intuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning. For\n","instance, the superiority of partial-order planning can depend critically upon\n","the search strategy and the structure of the search space. Understanding the\n","underlying assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners.\n","Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown\n","function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k &gt 2 values (i.e., k\n","``classes''). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training\n","examples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning\n","problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the\n","decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning\n","algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and\n","application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output\n","representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique\n","in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output\n","representation. We show that these output representations improve the\n","generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of\n","multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust\n","with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of\n","distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of\n","overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we\n","show that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can\n","provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results\n","demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method\n","for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass\n","problems.\n","The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and plan\n","debugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation - modifying or\n","repairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this paper we provide a\n","domain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound,\n","complete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the\n","literature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of\n","partial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from\n","node to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a\n","library plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for\n","the search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same\n","refinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract\n","constraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that\n","the adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its\n","systematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any\n","parts of the graph.\n","Temporal difference (TD) methods constitute a class of methods for learning\n","predictions in multi-step prediction problems, parameterized by a recency\n","factor lambda. Currently the most important application of these methods is to\n","temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement\n","learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of\n","TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general\n","implementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement\n","learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional\n","approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both\n","inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences)\n","procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates\n","TD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used\n","with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is\n","derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far.\n","Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda\n","&gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning\n","speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.\n","This paper introduces ICET, a new algorithm for cost-sensitive\n","classification. ICET uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of biases\n","for a decision tree induction algorithm. The fitness function of the genetic\n","algorithm is the average cost of classification when using the decision tree,\n","including both the costs of tests (features, measurements) and the costs of\n","classification errors. ICET is compared here with three other algorithms for\n","cost-sensitive classification - EG2, CS-ID3, and IDX - and also with C4.5,\n","which classifies without regard to cost. The five algorithms are evaluated\n","empirically on five real-world medical datasets. Three sets of experiments are\n","performed. The first set examines the baseline performance of the five\n","algorithms on the five datasets and establishes that ICET performs\n","significantly better than its competitors. The second set tests the robustness\n","of ICET under a variety of conditions and shows that ICET maintains its\n","advantage. The third set looks at ICET's search in bias space and discovers a\n","way to improve the search.\n","Theory revision integrates inductive learning and background knowledge by\n","combining training examples with a coarse domain theory to produce a more\n","accurate theory. There are two challenges that theory revision and other\n","theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for\n","the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the\n","original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more\n","accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky,\n","cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a\n","coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that\n","produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for\n","accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required.\n","Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible\n","representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision\n","systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and\n","weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the\n","underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided\n","constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over\n","previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior,\n","limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction.\n","Many studies have been carried out in order to increase the search efficiency\n","of constraint satisfaction problems; among them, some make use of structural\n","properties of the constraint network; others take into account semantic\n","properties of the constraints, generally assuming that all the constraints\n","possess the given property. In this paper, we propose a new decomposition\n","method benefiting from both semantic properties of functional constraints (not\n","bijective constraints) and structural properties of the network; furthermore,\n","not all the constraints need to be functional. We show that under some\n","conditions, the existence of solutions can be guaranteed. We first characterize\n","a particular subset of the variables, which we name a root set. We then\n","introduce pivot consistency, a new local consistency which is a weak form of\n","path consistency and can be achieved in O(n^2d^2) complexity (instead of\n","O(n^3d^3) for path consistency), and we present associated properties; in\n","particular, we show that any consistent instantiation of the root set can be\n","linearly extended to a solution, which leads to the presentation of the\n","aforementioned new method for solving by decomposing functional CSPs.\n","We study the process of multi-agent reinforcement learning in the context of\n","load balancing in a distributed system, without use of either central\n","coordination or explicit communication. We first define a precise framework in\n","which to study adaptive load balancing, important features of which are its\n","stochastic nature and the purely local information available to individual\n","agents. Given this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay\n","between basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on system\n","efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in\n","heterogeneous populations, and address the issue of exploration vs.\n","exploitation in that context. Finally, we show that naive use of communication\n","may not improve, and might even harm system efficiency.\n","Since its inception, artificial intelligence has relied upon a theoretical\n","foundation centered around perfect rationality as the desired property of\n","intelligent systems. We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is\n","inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a\n","result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI,\n","hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded\n","optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a\n","solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture\n","and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property\n","for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time\n","environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated\n","mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded\n","optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical\n","complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs\n","that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO\n","programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude\n","with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical\n","basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and\n","game theory.\n","We present algorithms that learn certain classes of function-free recursive\n","logic programs in polynomial time from equivalence queries. In particular, we\n","show that a single k-ary recursive constant-depth determinate clause is\n","learnable. Two-clause programs consisting of one learnable recursive clause and\n","one constant-depth determinate non-recursive clause are also learnable, if an\n","additional ``basecase'' oracle is assumed. These results immediately imply the\n","pac-learnability of these classes. Although these classes of learnable\n","recursive programs are very constrained, it is shown in a companion paper that\n","they are maximally general, in that generalizing either class in any natural\n","way leads to a computationally difficult learning problem. Thus, taken together\n","with its companion paper, this paper establishes a boundary of efficient\n","learnability for recursive logic programs.\n","In a companion paper it was shown that the class of constant-depth\n","determinate k-ary recursive clauses is efficiently learnable. In this paper we\n","present negative results showing that any natural generalization of this class\n","is hard to learn in Valiant's model of pac-learnability. In particular, we show\n","that the following program classes are cryptographically hard to learn:\n","programs with an unbounded number of constant-depth linear recursive clauses;\n","programs with one constant-depth determinate clause containing an unbounded\n","number of recursive calls; and programs with one linear recursive clause of\n","constant locality. These results immediately imply the non-learnability of any\n","more general class of programs. We also show that learning a constant-depth\n","determinate program with either two linear recursive clauses or one linear\n","recursive clause and one non-recursive clause is as hard as learning boolean\n","DNF. Together with positive results from the companion paper, these negative\n","results establish a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive\n","function-free clauses.\n","There has been evidence that least-commitment planners can efficiently handle\n","planning problems that involve difficult goal interactions. This evidence has\n","led to the common belief that delayed-commitment is the \"best\" possible\n","planning strategy. However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment\n","planners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in\n","particular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of\n","trying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner\n","that can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which\n","planning strategies. In this article we introduce this new planning algorithm,\n","FLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy with respect to plan-step\n","orderings. It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to\n","eager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering\n","commitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using\n","a simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can\n","vary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also\n","during the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel\n","contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which\n","commitment strategy to use while planning. FLECS provides a framework to\n","investigate the mapping from planning domains and problems to efficient\n","planning strategies.\n","This paper presents a method for inducing logic programs from examples that\n","learns a new class of concepts called first-order decision lists, defined as\n","ordered lists of clauses each ending in a cut. The method, called FOIDL, is\n","based on FOIL (Quinlan, 1990) but employs intensional background knowledge and\n","avoids the need for explicit negative examples. It is particularly useful for\n","problems that involve rules with specific exceptions, such as learning the\n","past-tense of English verbs, a task widely studied in the context of the\n","symbolic/connectionist debate. FOIDL is able to learn concise, accurate\n","programs for this problem from significantly fewer examples than previous\n","methods (both connectionist and symbolic).\n","ion is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of\n","problem solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a\n","domain description -- as used in most hierarchical planners -- has proven\n","useful. In this paper we present examples which illustrate significant\n","drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we\n","propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of\n","representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a\n","related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change\n","of representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract.\n","However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the\n","abstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of\n","abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction\n","approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated\n","System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned\n","from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning\n","in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed\n","reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning.\n","Identifying inaccurate data has long been regarded as a significant and\n","difficult problem in AI. In this paper, we present a new method for identifying\n","inaccurate data on the basis of qualitative correlations among related data.\n","First, we introduce the definitions of related data and qualitative\n","correlations among related data. Then we put forward a new concept called\n","support coefficient function (SCF). SCF can be used to extract, represent, and\n","calculate qualitative correlations among related data within a dataset. We\n","propose an approach to determining dynamic shift intervals of inaccurate data,\n","and an approach to calculating possibility of identifying inaccurate data,\n","respectively. Both of the approaches are based on SCF. Finally we present an\n","algorithm for identifying inaccurate data by using qualitative correlations\n","among related data as confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence. We have\n","developed a practical system for interpreting infrared spectra by applying the\n","method, and have fully tested the system against several hundred real spectra.\n","The experimental results show that the method is significantly better than the\n","conventional methods used in many similar systems.\n","Learning and reasoning are both aspects of what is considered to be\n","intelligence. Their studies within AI have been separated historically,\n","learning being the topic of machine learning and neural networks, and reasoning\n","falling under classical (or symbolic) AI. However, learning and reasoning are\n","in many ways interdependent. This paper discusses the nature of some of these\n","interdependencies and proposes a general framework called FLARE, that combines\n","inductive learning using prior knowledge together with reasoning in a\n","propositional setting. Several examples that test the framework are presented,\n","including classical induction, many important reasoning protocols and two\n","simple expert systems.\n","This paper studies the problem of ergodicity of transition probability\n","matrices in Markovian models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), and how it\n","makes very difficult the task of learning to represent long-term context for\n","sequential data. This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term\n","context information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to\n","represent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information\n","backwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this\n","problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition\n","probabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are\n","sparse and the model essentially deterministic. The results found in this paper\n","apply to learning approaches based on continuous optimization, such as gradient\n","descent and the Baum-Welch algorithm.\n","Symmetric networks designed for energy minimization such as Boltzman machines\n","and Hopfield nets are frequently investigated for use in optimization,\n","constraint satisfaction and approximation of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless,\n","finding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is\n","not guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of\n","steps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used\n","for such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is\n","found in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate,\n","is uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify\n","tree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid\n","local minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is\n","guaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system\n","(self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On\n","the negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm\n","exists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous\n","scheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while\n","a synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step.\n","In addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when\n","the scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be\n","improved using the cycle-cutset scheme. The general algorithm, called\n","activate-with-cutset, improves over activate and has some performance\n","guarantees that are related to the size of the network's cycle-cutset.\n","Functionality-based recognition systems recognize objects at the category\n","level by reasoning about how well the objects support the expected function.\n","Such systems naturally associate a ``measure of goodness'' or ``membership\n","value'' with a recognized object. This measure of goodness is the result of\n","combining individual measures, or membership values, from potentially many\n","primitive evaluations of different properties of the object's shape. A\n","membership function is used to compute the membership value when evaluating a\n","primitive of a particular physical property of an object. In previous versions\n","of a recognition system known as Gruff, the membership function for each of the\n","primitive evaluations was hand-crafted by the system designer. In this paper,\n","we provide a learning component for the Gruff system, called Omlet, that\n","automatically learns membership functions given a set of example objects\n","labeled with their desired category measure. The learning algorithm is\n","generally applicable to any problem in which low-level membership values are\n","combined through an and-or tree structure to give a final overall membership\n","value.\n","This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive\n","tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a\n","flexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an\n","instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in\n","whatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the\n","agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of\n","instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves\n","such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It\n","combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each\n","instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete\n","explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar\n","that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from\n","interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key\n","requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous\n","systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point;\n","(2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to\n","a hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance,\n","conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class\n","of knowledge it uses to perform tasks.\n","OPUS is a branch and bound search algorithm that enables efficient admissible\n","search through spaces for which the order of search operator application is not\n","significant. The algorithm's search efficiency is demonstrated with respect to\n","very large machine learning search spaces. The use of admissible search is of\n","potential value to the machine learning community as it means that the exact\n","learning biases to be employed for complex learning tasks can be precisely\n","specified and manipulated. OPUS also has potential for application in other\n","areas of artificial intelligence, notably, truth maintenance.\n","The main aim of this work is the development of a vision-based road detection\n","system fast enough to cope with the difficult real-time constraints imposed by\n","moving vehicle applications. The hardware platform, a special-purpose massively\n","parallel system, has been chosen to minimize system production and operational\n","costs. This paper presents a novel approach to expectation-driven low-level\n","image segmentation, which can be mapped naturally onto mesh-connected massively\n","parallel SIMD architectures capable of handling hierarchical data structures.\n","The input image is assumed to contain a distorted version of a given template;\n","a multiresolution stretching process is used to reshape the original template\n","in accordance with the acquired image content, minimizing a potential function.\n","The distorted template is the process output.\n","In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and\n","the usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently\n","there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in\n","machine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform\n","generalization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of\n","implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique\n","to compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under\n","implication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate\n","for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is\n","the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between\n","clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of\n","implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show\n","that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general\n","generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce\n","generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under\n","theta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover\n","we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete\n","expansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the\n","clause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion.\n","We present a definition of cause and effect in terms of decision-theoretic\n","primitives and thereby provide a principled foundation for causal reasoning.\n","Our definition departs from the traditional view of causation in that causal\n","assertions may vary with the set of decisions available. We argue that this\n","approach provides added clarity to the notion of cause. Also in this paper, we\n","examine the encoding of causal relationships in directed acyclic graphs. We\n","describe a special class of influence diagrams, those in canonical form, and\n","show its relationship to Pearl's representation of cause and effect. Finally,\n","we show how canonical form facilitates counterfactual reasoning.\n","Characteristic models are an alternative, model based, representation for\n","Horn expressions. It has been shown that these two representations are\n","incomparable and each has its advantages over the other. It is therefore\n","natural to ask what is the cost of translating, back and forth, between these\n","representations. Interestingly, the same translation questions arise in\n","database theory, where it has applications to the design of relational\n","databases. This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems.\n","Our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under\n","polynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding\n","decision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given\n","set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression.\n","We also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well\n","known problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no\n","polynomial time algorithm is known. It is shown that in general our translation\n","problems are at least as hard as the hypergraph transversal problem, and in a\n","special case they are equivalent to it.\n","This article describes an application of three well-known statistical methods\n","in the field of game-tree search: using a large number of classified Othello\n","positions, feature weights for evaluation functions with a\n","game-phase-independent meaning are estimated by means of logistic regression,\n","Fisher's linear discriminant, and the quadratic discriminant function for\n","normally distributed features. Thereafter, the playing strengths are compared\n","by means of tournaments between the resulting versions of a world-class Othello\n","program. In this application, logistic regression - which is used here for the\n","first time in the context of game playing - leads to better results than the\n","other approaches.\n","We describe a machine learning method for predicting the value of a\n","real-valued function, given the values of multiple input variables. The method\n","induces solutions from samples in the form of ordered disjunctive normal form\n","(DNF) decision rules. A central objective of the method and representation is\n","the induction of compact, easily interpretable solutions. This rule-based\n","decision model can be extended to search efficiently for similar cases prior to\n","approximating function values. Experimental results on real-world data\n","demonstrate that the new techniques are competitive with existing machine\n","learning and statistical methods and can sometimes yield superior regression\n","performance.\n","Many applications -- from planning and scheduling to problems in molecular\n","biology -- rely heavily on a temporal reasoning component. In this paper, we\n","discuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal\n","reasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for\n","representing temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for\n","determining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding\n","one or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two\n","important algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a\n","backtracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop\n","techniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly\n","optimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable\n","and value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically\n","improve the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously\n","suggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time\n","and space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the\n","techniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems\n","that are of practical size.\n","The paper describes an extension of well-founded semantics for logic programs\n","with two types of negation. In this extension information about preferences\n","between rules can be expressed in the logical language and derived dynamically.\n","This is achieved by using a reserved predicate symbol and a naming technique.\n","Conflicts among rules are resolved whenever possible on the basis of derived\n","preference information. The well-founded conclusions of prioritized logic\n","programs can be computed in polynomial time. A legal reasoning example\n","illustrates the usefulness of the approach.\n","Traditional databases commonly support efficient query and update procedures\n","that operate in time which is sublinear in the size of the database. Our goal\n","in this paper is to take a first step toward dynamic reasoning in probabilistic\n","databases with comparable efficiency. We propose a dynamic data structure that\n","supports efficient algorithms for updating and querying singly connected\n","Bayesian networks. In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in\n","O(1) time and queries are processed in time O(N), where N is the size of the\n","network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us\n","to answer queries in time O(log N) at the expense of O(log N) time per evidence\n","absorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in\n","applications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic\n","databases. We briefly discuss a potential application of dynamic probabilistic\n","reasoning in computational biology.\n","We introduce an algorithm for combinatorial search on quantum computers that\n","is capable of significantly concentrating amplitude into solutions for some NP\n","search problems, on average. This is done by exploiting the same aspects of\n","problem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive\n","search choices. This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions\n","than the simple direct use of quantum parallelism. Furthermore, empirical\n","evaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same\n","phase transition behavior, and at the same location, as seen in many previously\n","studied classical search methods. Specifically, difficult problem instances are\n","concentrated near the abrupt change from underconstrained to overconstrained\n","problems.\n","We develop a mean field theory for sigmoid belief networks based on ideas\n","from statistical mechanics. Our mean field theory provides a tractable\n","approximation to the true probability distribution in these networks; it also\n","yields a lower bound on the likelihood of evidence. We demonstrate the utility\n","of this framework on a benchmark problem in statistical pattern\n","recognition---the classification of handwritten digits.\n","A reported weakness of C4.5 in domains with continuous attributes is\n","addressed by modifying the formation and evaluation of tests on continuous\n","attributes. An MDL-inspired penalty is applied to such tests, eliminating some\n","of them from consideration and altering the relative desirability of all tests.\n","Empirical trials show that the modifications lead to smaller decision trees\n","with higher predictive accuracies. Results also confirm that a new version of\n","C4.5 incorporating these changes is superior to recent approaches that use\n","global discretization and that construct small trees with multi-interval\n","splits.\n","For many types of machine learning algorithms, one can compute the\n","statistically `optimal' way to select training data. In this paper, we review\n","how optimal data selection techniques have been used with feedforward neural\n","networks. We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for\n","two alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of\n","Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural\n","networks are computationally expensive and approximate, the techniques for\n","mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression are both efficient and\n","accurate. Empirically, we observe that the optimality criterion sharply\n","decreases the number of training examples the learner needs in order to achieve\n","good performance.\n","Inductive theorem provers often diverge. This paper describes a simple\n","critic, a computer program which monitors the construction of inductive proofs\n","attempting to identify diverging proof attempts. Divergence is recognized by\n","means of a ``difference matching'' procedure. The critic then proposes lemmas\n","and generalizations which ``ripple'' these differences away so that the proof\n","can go through without divergence. The critic enables the theorem prover Spike\n","to prove many theorems completely automatically from the definitions alone.\n","Termination of logic programs with negated body atoms (here called general\n","logic programs) is an important topic. One reason is that many computational\n","mechanisms used to process negated atoms, like Clark's negation as failure and\n","Chan's constructive negation, are based on termination conditions. This paper\n","introduces a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs\n","w.r.t. the Prolog selection rule. The idea is to distinguish parts of the\n","program depending on whether or not their termination depends on the selection\n","rule. To this end, the notions of low-, weakly up-, and up-acceptable program\n","are introduced. We use these notions to develop a methodology for proving\n","termination of general logic programs, and show how interesting problems in\n","non-monotonic reasoning can be formalized and implemented by means of\n","terminating general logic programs.\n","Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering\n","systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality\n","and the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the\n","search strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but\n","be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both\n","ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs\n","a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative\n","optimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings.\n","Given this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial\n","clusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative\n","optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search\n","of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative\n","optimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been\n","constructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific\n","criteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic\n","performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over\n","completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this\n","performance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by\n","supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical\n","clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we\n","propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures\n","for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and\n","simplicity dimensions.\n","This paper presents new experimental evidence against the utility of Occam's\n","razor. A~systematic procedure is presented for post-processing decision trees\n","produced by C4.5. This procedure was derived by rejecting Occam's razor and\n","instead attending to the assumption that similar objects are likely to belong\n","to the same class. It increases a decision tree's complexity without altering\n","the performance of that tree on the training data from which it is inferred.\n","The resulting more complex decision trees are demonstrated to have, on average,\n","for a variety of common learning tasks, higher predictive accuracy than the\n","less complex original decision trees. This result raises considerable doubt\n","about the utility of Occam's razor as it is commonly applied in modern machine\n","learning.\n","The main operations in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are generalization\n","and specialization, which only make sense in a generality order. In ILP, the\n","three most important generality orders are subsumption, implication and\n","implication relative to background knowledge. The two languages used most often\n","are languages of clauses and languages of only Horn clauses. This gives a total\n","of six different ordered languages. In this paper, we give a systematic\n","treatment of the existence or non-existence of least generalizations and\n","greatest specializations of finite sets of clauses in each of these six ordered\n","sets. We survey results already obtained by others and also contribute some\n","answers of our own. Our main new results are, firstly, the existence of a\n","computable least generalization under implication of every finite set of\n","clauses containing at least one non-tautologous function-free clause (among\n","other, not necessarily function-free clauses). Secondly, we show that such a\n","least generalization need not exist under relative implication, not even if\n","both the set that is to be generalized and the background knowledge are\n","function-free. Thirdly, we give a complete discussion of existence and\n","non-existence of greatest specializations in each of the six ordered languages.\n","This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a\n","computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers\n","familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a\n","broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the\n","problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error\n","interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a\n","resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and\n","in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of\n","reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation,\n","establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning\n","from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate\n","learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden\n","state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment\n","of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.\n","Although most scheduling problems are NP-hard, domain specific techniques\n","perform well in practice but are quite expensive to construct. In adaptive\n","problem-solving solving, domain specific knowledge is acquired automatically\n","for a general problem solver with a flexible control architecture. In this\n","approach, a learning system explores a space of possible heuristic methods for\n","one well-suited to the eccentricities of the given domain and problem\n","distribution. In this article, we discuss an application of the approach to\n","scheduling satellite communications. Using problem distributions based on\n","actual mission requirements, our approach identifies strategies that not only\n","decrease the amount of CPU time required to produce schedules, but also\n","increase the percentage of problems that are solvable within computational\n","resource limitations.\n","Speedup learning seeks to improve the computational efficiency of problem\n","solving with experience. In this paper, we develop a formal framework for\n","learning efficient problem solving from random problems and their solutions. We\n","apply this framework to two different representations of learned knowledge,\n","namely control rules and macro-operators, and prove theorems that identify\n","sufficient conditions for learning in each representation. Our proofs are\n","constructive in that they are accompanied with learning algorithms. Our\n","framework captures both empirical and explanation-based speedup learning in a\n","unified fashion. We illustrate our framework with implementations in two\n","domains: symbolic integration and Eight Puzzle. This work integrates many\n","strands of experimental and theoretical work in machine learning, including\n","empirical learning of control rules, macro-operator learning, Explanation-Based\n","Learning (EBL), and Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning.\n","A fundamental assumption made by classical AI planners is that there is no\n","uncertainty in the world: the planner has full knowledge of the conditions\n","under which the plan will be executed and the outcome of every action is fully\n","predictable. These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e.,\n","plans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In\n","this paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and\n","construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order\n","contingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the\n","agent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The\n","decision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are\n","planned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes\n","the process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The\n","explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to\n","the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions\n","such as the use of different decision-making procedures.\n","An important problem in geometric reasoning is to find the configuration of a\n","collection of geometric bodies so as to satisfy a set of given constraints.\n","Recently, it has been suggested that this problem can be solved efficiently by\n","symbolically reasoning about geometry. This approach, called degrees of freedom\n","analysis, employs a set of specialized routines called plan fragments that\n","specify how to change the configuration of a set of bodies to satisfy a new\n","constraint while preserving existing constraints. A potential drawback, which\n","limits the scalability of this approach, is concerned with the difficulty of\n","writing plan fragments. In this paper we address this limitation by showing how\n","these plan fragments can be automatically synthesized using first principles\n","about geometric bodies, actions, and topology.\n","Motivated by the control theoretic distinction between controllable and\n","uncontrollable events, we distinguish between two types of agents within a\n","multi-agent system: controllable agents, which are directly controlled by the\n","system's designer, and uncontrollable agents, which are not under the\n","designer's direct control. We refer to such systems as partially controlled\n","multi-agent systems, and we investigate how one might influence the behavior of\n","the uncontrolled agents through appropriate design of the controlled agents. In\n","particular, we wish to understand which problems are naturally described in\n","these terms, what methods can be applied to influence the uncontrollable\n","agents, the effectiveness of such methods, and whether similar methods work\n","across different domains. Using a game-theoretic framework, this paper studies\n","the design of partially controlled multi-agent systems in two contexts: in one\n","context, the uncontrollable agents are expected utility maximizers, while in\n","the other they are reinforcement learners. We suggest different techniques for\n","controlling agents' behavior in each domain, assess their success, and examine\n","their relationship.\n","Visual thinking plays an important role in scientific reasoning. Based on the\n","research in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems,\n","nonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have\n","identified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning\n","organizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that\n","perceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure\n","and behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to\n","perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical\n","methods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to\n","unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program\n","written in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous\n","field and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level\n","descriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a\n","multi-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by\n","forming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of\n","generic operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to\n","perform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and\n","successively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the\n","neighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To\n","illustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three\n","implemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the\n","spatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of\n","commonly used routines.\n","Finding the stable models of a knowledge base is a significant computational\n","problem in artificial intelligence. This task is at the computational heart of\n","truth maintenance systems, autoepistemic logic, and default logic.\n","Unfortunately, it is NP-hard. In this paper we present a hierarchy of classes\n","of knowledge bases, Omega_1,Omega_2,..., with the following properties: first,\n","Omega_1 is the class of all stratified knowledge bases; second, if a knowledge\n","base Pi is in Omega_k, then Pi has at most k stable models, and all of them may\n","be found in time O(lnk), where l is the length of the knowledge base and n the\n","number of atoms in Pi; third, for an arbitrary knowledge base Pi, we can find\n","the minimum k such that Pi belongs to Omega_k in time polynomial in the size of\n","Pi; and, last, where K is the class of all knowledge bases, it is the case that\n","union{i=1 to infty} Omega_i = K, that is, every knowledge base belongs to some\n","class in the hierarchy.\n","We propose some domain-independent techniques for bringing well-founded\n","partial-order planners closer to practicality. The first two techniques are\n","aimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is\n","based on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to\n","select plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero\n","commitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO\n","prioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator\n","parameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from\n","the definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a\n","polynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the\n","operator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter\n","domains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove\n","spurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP,\n","our improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors\n","ranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial\n","for the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest\n","improvements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave\n","speedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the\n","default UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for\n","our techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices.\n","Cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly signal discourse\n","structure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than\n","structural information. Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or\n","sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit\n","discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and\n","plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for\n","classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning\n","programs (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets\n","of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine\n","learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the\n","generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous\n","results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the\n","literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain\n","new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to\n","automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively\n","analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data.\n","Finally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and\n","flexible than manual methods.\n","This paper lays part of the groundwork for a domain theory of negotiation,\n","that is, a way of classifying interactions so that it is clear, given a domain,\n","which negotiation mechanisms and strategies are appropriate. We define State\n","Oriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient\n","conditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an\n","altered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of\n","joint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict\n","resolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial\n","cooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in\n","fundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A\n","Unified Negotiation Protocol (UNP) is developed that can be used in all types\n","of encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a\n","partial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents'\n","goals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational\n","agreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where\n","agents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents.\n","First we consider the case where agents' goals are private information, and we\n","analyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase\n","their utility. Then, we consider the situation where the agents' goals (and\n","therefore stand-alone costs) are common knowledge, but the worth they attach to\n","their goals is private information. We introduce two mechanisms, one 'strict',\n","the other 'tolerant', and analyze their affects on the stability and efficiency\n","of negotiation outcomes.\n","First-order learning involves finding a clause-form definition of a relation\n","from examples of the relation and relevant background information. In this\n","paper, a particular first-order learning system is modified to customize it for\n","finding definitions of functional relations. This restriction leads to faster\n","learning times and, in some cases, to definitions that have higher predictive\n","accuracy. Other first-order learning systems might benefit from similar\n","specialization.\n","This paper describes an extension to the constraint satisfaction problem\n","(CSP) called MUSE CSP (MUltiply SEgmented Constraint Satisfaction Problem).\n","This extension is especially useful for those problems which segment into\n","multiple sets of partially shared variables. Such problems arise naturally in\n","signal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing,\n","and handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to\n","segment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by\n","the segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent\n","several similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple\n","instances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and\n","constraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP,\n","reducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts\n","of MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We\n","then demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically\n","ambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often\n","generated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be\n","used to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences. Algorithms for\n","MUSE arc and path consistency are provided. Finally, we discuss how to create a\n","MUSE CSP from a set of CSPs which are labeled to indicate when the same\n","variable is shared by more than a single CSP.\n","A new method is proposed for exploiting causal independencies in exact\n","Bayesian network inference. A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a\n","factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of\n","conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that\n","enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a\n","combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain\n","factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal\n","independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given\n","its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as\n","``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a\n","simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a\n","query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of\n","the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal\n","independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical\n","diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and\n","allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms.\n","Efficiently entering information into a computer is key to enjoying the\n","benefits of computing. This paper describes three intelligent user interfaces:\n","handwriting recognition, adaptive menus, and predictive fillin. In the context\n","of adding a personUs name and address to an electronic organizer, tests show\n","handwriting recognition is slower than typing on an on-screen, soft keyboard,\n","while adaptive menus and predictive fillin can be twice as fast. This paper\n","also presents strategies for applying these three interfaces to other\n","information collection domains.\n","Decomposable dependency models possess a number of interesting and useful\n","properties. This paper presents new characterizations of decomposable models in\n","terms of independence relationships, which are obtained by adding a single\n","axiom to the well-known set characterizing dependency models that are\n","isomorphic to undirected graphs. We also briefly discuss a potential\n","application of our results to the problem of learning graphical models from\n","data.\n","Instance-based learning techniques typically handle continuous and linear\n","input values well, but often do not handle nominal input attributes\n","appropriately. The Value Difference Metric (VDM) was designed to find\n","reasonable distance values between nominal attribute values, but it largely\n","ignores continuous attributes, requiring discretization to map continuous\n","values into nominal values. This paper proposes three new heterogeneous\n","distance functions, called the Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric (HVDM),\n","the Interpolated Value Difference Metric (IVDM), and the Windowed Value\n","Difference Metric (WVDM). These new distance functions are designed to handle\n","applications with nominal attributes, continuous attributes, or both. In\n","experiments on 48 applications the new distance metrics achieve higher\n","classification accuracy on average than three previous distance functions on\n","those datasets that have both nominal and continuous attributes.\n","Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have\n","been based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and\n","symbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or\n","connectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use\n","a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic\n","component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning\n","robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a\n","flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for\n","analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather\n","than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist\n","analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language\n","processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of\n","connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the\n","SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In\n","this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the\n","flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer,\n","and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of\n","noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat\n","representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language\n","than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the\n","fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a\n","flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an\n","overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.\n","Most modern formalisms used in Databases and Artificial Intelligence for\n","describing an application domain are based on the notions of class (or concept)\n","and relationship among classes. One interesting feature of such formalisms is\n","the possibility of defining a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that\n","precisely characterize the instances of the class. Many recent articles point\n","out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition\n","containing some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of\n","choosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a\n","formalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the\n","feasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation\n","formalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In\n","addition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers,\n","and qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs\n","to express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs\n","enable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of\n","recursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc.\n","We establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the\n","computational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a\n","particular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus.\n","We argue that the analysis of agent/environment interactions should be\n","extended to include the conventions and invariants maintained by agents\n","throughout their activity. We refer to this thicker notion of environment as a\n","lifeworld and present a partial set of formal tools for describing structures\n","of lifeworlds and the ways in which they computationally simplify activity. As\n","one specific example, we apply the tools to the analysis of the Toast system\n","and show how versions of the system with very different control structures in\n","fact implement a common control structure together with different conventions\n","for encoding task state in the positions or states of objects in the\n","environment.\n","We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks,\n","which consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic\n","expression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple\n","evaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a\n","number, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the\n","answer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest.\n","It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms\n","for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using\n","clustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a\n","Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the\n","inference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation\n","algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a\n","standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended\n","value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to\n","utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed\n","framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different\n","software and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation\n","algorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes:\n","simple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex\n","optimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning\n","and computation-caching.\n","An algorithm that learns from a set of examples should ideally be able to\n","exploit the available resources of (a) abundant computing power and (b)\n","domain-specific knowledge to improve its ability to generalize. Connectionist\n","theory-refinement systems, which use background knowledge to select a neural\n","network's topology and initial weights, have proven to be effective at\n","exploiting domain-specific knowledge; however, most do not exploit available\n","computing power. This weakness occurs because they lack the ability to refine\n","the topology of the neural networks they produce, thereby limiting\n","generalization, especially when given impoverished domain theories. We present\n","the REGENT algorithm which uses (a) domain-specific knowledge to help create an\n","initial population of knowledge-based neural networks and (b) genetic operators\n","of crossover and mutation (specifically designed for knowledge-based networks)\n","to continually search for better network topologies. Experiments on three\n","real-world domains indicate that our new algorithm is able to significantly\n","increase generalization compared to a standard connectionist theory-refinement\n","system, as well as our previous algorithm for growing knowledge-based networks.\n","Several recent studies have compared the relative efficiency of alternative\n","flaw selection strategies for partial-order causal link (POCL) planning. We\n","review this literature, and present new experimental results that generalize\n","the earlier work and explain some of the discrepancies in it. In particular, we\n","describe the Least-Cost Flaw Repair (LCFR) strategy developed and analyzed by\n","Joslin and Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including\n","Gerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy. LCFR and ZLIFO make very\n","different, and apparently conflicting claims about the most effective way to\n","reduce search-space size in POCL planning. We resolve this conflict, arguing\n","that much of the benefit that Gerevini and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO\n","component of their ZLIFO strategy is better attributed to other causes. We show\n","that for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with\n","the delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size,\n","and will do so without excessive computational overhead. Although such a\n","strategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain domain\n","characteristics may reduce its effectiveness.\n","We investigate the computational properties of the spatial algebra RCC-5\n","which is a restricted version of the RCC framework for spatial reasoning. The\n","satisfiability problem for RCC-5 is known to be NP-complete but not much is\n","known about its approximately four billion subclasses. We provide a complete\n","classification of satisfiability for all these subclasses into polynomial and\n","NP-complete respectively. In the process, we identify all maximal tractable\n","subalgebras which are four in total.\n","The easy-hard-easy pattern in the difficulty of combinatorial search problems\n","as constraints are added has been explained as due to a competition between the\n","decrease in number of solutions and increased pruning. We test the generality\n","of this explanation by examining one of its predictions: if the number of\n","solutions is held fixed by the choice of problems, then increased pruning\n","should lead to a monotonic decrease in search cost. Instead, we find the\n","easy-hard-easy pattern in median search cost even when the number of solutions\n","is held constant, for some search methods. This generalizes previous\n","observations of this pattern and shows that the existing theory does not\n","explain the full range of the peak in search cost. In these cases the pattern\n","appears to be due to changes in the size of the minimal unsolvable subproblems,\n","rather than changing numbers of solutions.\n","This paper combines two important directions of research in temporal\n","resoning: that of finding maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval\n","algebra, and that of reasoning with metric temporal information. Eight new\n","maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra are presented, some of\n","them subsuming previously reported tractable algebras. The algebras allow for\n","metric temporal constraints on interval starting or ending points, using the\n","recent framework of Horn DLRs. Two of the algebras can express the notion of\n","sequentiality between intervals, being the first such algebras admitting both\n","qualitative and metric time.\n","Starting with a likelihood or preference order on worlds, we extend it to a\n","likelihood ordering on sets of worlds in a natural way, and examine the\n","resulting logic. Lewis earlier considered such a notion of relative likelihood\n","in the context of studying counterfactuals, but he assumed a total preference\n","order on worlds. Complications arise when examining partial orders that are not\n","present for total orders. There are subtleties involving the exact approach to\n","lifting the order on worlds to an order on sets of worlds. In addition, the\n","axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in the case of partial\n","orders gives insight into the connection between relative likelihood and\n","default reasoning.\n","Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams for complex,\n","dynamic multi-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such as\n","education, training, entertainment, information integration, and collective\n","robotics. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains\n","obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter\n","differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment.\n","Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities\n","or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and\n","communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting\n","individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their\n","inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their\n","domain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key\n","to such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of\n","teamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination\n","and communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models\n","enable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing\n","consistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork,\n","called STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions\n","(Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a\n","(partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel\n","Grosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members\n","monitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team\n","as necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM\n","ensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate\n","sensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's\n","application in three different complex domains, and presents detailed empirical\n","results.\n","SEQUITUR is an algorithm that infers a hierarchical structure from a sequence\n","of discrete symbols by replacing repeated phrases with a grammatical rule that\n","generates the phrase, and continuing this process recursively. The result is a\n","hierarchical representation of the original sequence, which offers insights\n","into its lexical structure. The algorithm is driven by two constraints that\n","reduce the size of the grammar, and produce structure as a by-product. SEQUITUR\n","breaks new ground by operating incrementally. Moreover, the method's simple\n","structure permits a proof that it operates in space and time that is linear in\n","the size of the input. Our implementation can process 50,000 symbols per second\n","and has been applied to an extensive range of real world sequences.\n","Case-Based Planning (CBP) provides a way of scaling up domain-independent\n","planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed\n","and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous\n","planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve\n","performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance\n","improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem\n","similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning\n","effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP\n","depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes\n","the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner\n","DERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating\n","explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from\n","the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine\n","judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision\n","has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library,\n","through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as\n","single goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller\n","cases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this\n","approach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval\n","failure.\n","Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a natural model\n","for planning problems where effects of actions are nondeterministic and the\n","state of the world is not completely observable. It is difficult to solve\n","POMDPs exactly. This paper proposes a new approximation scheme. The basic idea\n","is to transform a POMDP into another one where additional information is\n","provided by an oracle. The oracle informs the planning agent that the current\n","state of the world is in a certain region. The transformed POMDP is\n","consequently said to be region observable. It is easier to solve than the\n","original POMDP. We propose to solve the transformed POMDP and use its optimal\n","policy to construct an approximate policy for the original POMDP. By\n","controlling the amount of additional information that the oracle provides, it\n","is possible to find a proper tradeoff between computational time and\n","approximation quality. In terms of algorithmic contributions, we study in\n","details how to exploit region observability in solving the transformed POMDP.\n","To facilitate the study, we also propose a new exact algorithm for general\n","POMDPs. The algorithm is conceptually simple and yet is significantly more\n","efficient than all previous exact algorithms.\n","The model of a non-Bayesian agent who faces a repeated game with incomplete\n","information against Nature is an appropriate tool for modeling general\n","agent-environment interactions. In such a model the environment state\n","(controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function\n","is initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a\n","prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his\n","reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action\n","to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are\n","considered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able\n","to observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the\n","other -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is\n","the reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable\n","processes, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result\n","refers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We\n","prove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the\n","competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high\n","probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It\n","is further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect\n","monitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case\n","there does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run\n","optimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove\n","that a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect\n","monitoring case under this criterion. Finally we show that our approach to\n","long-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from\n","previous work in this area.\n","Local search algorithms for combinatorial search problems frequently\n","encounter a sequence of states in which it is impossible to improve the value\n","of the objective function; moves through these regions, called plateau moves,\n","dominate the time spent in local search. We analyze and characterize plateaus\n","for three different classes of randomly generated Boolean Satisfiability\n","problems. We identify several interesting features of plateaus that impact the\n","performance of local search algorithms. We show that local minima tend to be\n","small but occasionally may be very large. We also show that local minima can be\n","escaped without unsatisfying a large number of clauses, but that systematically\n","searching for an escape route may be computationally expensive if the local\n","minimum is large. We show that plateaus with exits, called benches, tend to be\n","much larger than minima, and that some benches have very few exit states which\n","local search can use to escape. We show that the solutions (i.e., global\n","minima) of randomly generated problem instances form clusters, which behave\n","similarly to local minima. We revisit several enhancements of local search\n","algorithms and explain their performance in light of our results. Finally we\n","discuss strategies for creating the next generation of local search algorithms.\n","The assessment of bidirectional heuristic search has been incorrect since it\n","was first published more than a quarter of a century ago. For quite a long\n","time, this search strategy did not achieve the expected results, and there was\n","a major misunderstanding about the reasons behind it. Although there is still\n","wide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the\n","problem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this\n","conjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic\n","approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically\n","improving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These\n","approaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently\n","proposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding.\n","Empirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that\n","bidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with\n","limited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search\n","appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding\n","unidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a\n","search strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional\n","heuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered.\n","Approximating a general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its\n","Horn envelope and Horn core, respectively) was proposed by Selman and Kautz\n","(1991, 1996) as a form of ``knowledge compilation,'' supporting rapid\n","approximate reasoning; on the negative side, this scheme is static in that it\n","supports no updates, and has certain complexity drawbacks pointed out by\n","Kavvadias, Papadimitriou and Sideri (1993). On the other hand, the many\n","frameworks and schemes proposed in the literature for theory update and\n","revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the\n","Horn case, as was pointed out by Eiter and Gottlob (1992), and is further\n","demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not\n","inductive, in that they may lose in a single update any positive properties of\n","the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn structure, etc.). In this\n","paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn\n","approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very\n","efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is\n","represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the\n","upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and\n","similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which\n","enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when\n","the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn\n","formula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for\n","more complex updates.\n","An important characteristic of many logics for Artificial Intelligence is\n","their nonmonotonicity. This means that adding a formula to the premises can\n","invalidate some of the consequences. There may, however, exist formulae that\n","can always be safely added to the premises without destroying any of the\n","consequences: we say they respect monotonicity. Also, there may be formulae\n","that, when they are a consequence, can not be invalidated when adding any\n","formula to the premises: we call them conservative. We study these two classes\n","of formulae for preferential logics, and show that they are closely linked to\n","the formulae whose truth-value is preserved along the (preferential) ordering.\n","We will consider some preferential logics for illustration, and prove syntactic\n","characterization results for them. The results in this paper may improve the\n","efficiency of theorem provers for preferential logics.\n","Existing plan synthesis approaches in artificial intelligence fall into two\n","categories -- domain independent and domain dependent. The domain independent\n","approaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very\n","efficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be\n","(re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the\n","domain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these\n","approaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the\n","knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we\n","investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis\n","tools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture\n","called CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used\n","to derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a\n","declarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific\n","to a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive\n","domain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative\n","theory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach\n","by generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space\n","refinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform\n","classical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP,\n","Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will\n","contrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional\n","methods for customizing domain independent planners.\n","This paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for quick counting\n","for machine learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing\n","contingency tables, but our approach is also applicable to counting the number\n","of records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain\n","assumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of\n","the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero\n","entries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the\n","ADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for\n","this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically\n","demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large\n","real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates\n","memory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be\n","deduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near\n","its leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net\n","structure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection\n","algorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree\n","methods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the\n","possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the\n","merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as\n","kd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets.\n","In this paper we consider the problem of `theory patching', in which we are\n","given a domain theory, some of whose components are indicated to be possibly\n","flawed, and a set of labeled training examples for the domain concept. The\n","theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the\n","theory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training\n","examples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions\n","are made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is\n","to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching\n","problem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain\n","theories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of\n","determining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of\n","what revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining\n","stability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that\n","revisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification\n","of examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification\n","of examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used\n","to determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching\n","algorithms.\n","In this paper we re-investigate windowing for rule learning algorithms. We\n","show that, contrary to previous results for decision tree learning, windowing\n","can in fact achieve significant run-time gains in noise-free domains and\n","explain the different behavior of rule learning algorithms by the fact that\n","they learn each rule independently. The main contribution of this paper is\n","integrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this\n","property by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have\n","been discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent\n","iterations of the windowing process. Experimental evidence in a variety of\n","noise-free domains shows that integrative windowing can in fact achieve\n","substantial run-time gains. Furthermore, we discuss the problem of noise in\n","windowing and present an algorithm that is able to achieve run-time gains in a\n","set of experiments in a simple domain with artificial noise.\n","This paper presents a comprehensive approach for model-based diagnosis which\n","includes proposals for characterizing and computing preferred diagnoses,\n","assuming that the system description is augmented with a system structure (a\n","directed graph explicating the interconnections between system components).\n","Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a consequence, which is a\n","syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all\n","consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of\n","diagnoses, such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a\n","consequence. Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence\n","known as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard\n","variations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in\n","NNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure\n","does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF\n","which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show\n","a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the\n","topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm\n","that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The\n","algorithm is shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the\n","preference criterion satisfies some general conditions.\n","One of the most common mechanisms used for speeding up problem solvers is\n","macro-learning. Macros are sequences of basic operators acquired during problem\n","solving. Macros are used by the problem solver as if they were basic operators.\n","The major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros\n","that are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the\n","search space and can severely degrade problem-solving efficiency. To make macro\n","learning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros.\n","This paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros.\n","Solvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The\n","only macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local\n","minimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several\n","domains, including the domain of NxN sliding-tile puzzles. After learning on\n","small puzzles, the system is able to efficiently solve puzzles of any size.\n","An example is constructed of a local ring and a module of finite type and\n","finite projective dimension over that ring such that the module is not rigid.\n","This shows that the rigidity conjecture is false.\n","Let $\\u_{1\\times n}$, $\\X_{n\\times n}$, and $\\v_{n\\times 1}$ be matrices of\n","indeterminates, $\\Adj \\X$ be the classical adjoint of $\\X$, and $H(n)$ be the\n","ideal $I_1(\\u\\X)+I_1(\\X\\v)+I_1(\\v\\u-\\Adj \\X)$. Vasconcelos has conjectured that\n","$H(n)$ is a perfect Gorenstein ideal of grade $2n$. In this paper, we obtain\n","the minimal free resolution of $H(n)$; and thereby establish Vasconcelos'\n","conjecture.\n","Assume $R$ is a polynomial ring over a field and $I$ is a homogeneous\n","Gorenstein ideal of codimension $g\\ge3$ and initial degree $p\\ge2$.

We then study the\n","structure of the Rees algebra of these links, more specifically we describe\n","their canonical module in sufficient detail to be able to characterize\n","self--linked prime ideals. In the last section multiplicity estimates for\n","classes of such ideals are established.\n","In this paper we give an effective characterization of Hilbert functions and\n","polynomials of standard algebras over an Artinian equicharacteristic local\n","ring; the cohomological properties of such algebras are also studied.

We show that extremal Betti numbers of an\n","arbitrary submodule of a free S-module are preserved when taking the generic\n","initial module. We relate extremal multigraded Betti numbers in the minimal\n","resolution of a square free monomial ideal with those of the monomial ideal\n","corresponding to the Alexander dual simplicial complex and generalize theorems\n","of Eagon-Reiner and Terai. As an application we give easy (alternative) proofs\n","of classical criteria due to Hochster, Reisner, and Stanley.\n","The principal result is a primary decomposition of ideals generated by the\n","(2x2)-subpermanents of a generic matrix.

Thus the permanental ideals are almost never Cohen-Macaulay, in\n","contrast with determinantal ideals.\n","Let G be a finite group acting by automorphism on a lattice A, and hence on\n","the group algebra S=k[A]. The algebra of G-invariants in S is called an algebra\n","of multiplicative invariants.\n","  We investigate when algebras of multiplicative invariants are semigroup\n","algebras. In particular, we present an explicit version of a result of Farkas\n","stating that multiplicative invariants of finite reflection groups are indeed\n","semigroup algebras. On the other hand, multiplicative invariants arising from\n","fixed point free actions are shown to never be semigroup algebras. In\n","particular, this holds whenever G has odd prime order.\n","We study the ring of all functions from the positive integers to some field.\n","This ring, which we call \\emph{the ring of number-theoretic functions}, is an\n","inverse limit of the ``truncations'' \\Gamma_n consisting of all functions f for\n","which f(m)=0 whenever m > n.\n","  Each \\Gamma_n is a zero-dimensional, finitely generated (K)-algebra, which\n","may be expressed as the quotient of a finitely generated polynomial ring with a\n","\\emph{reversely stable} monomial ideal.

In\n","sections 2 to 6 we give a construction of a system of parametric equations\n","describing such valuations. This amounts to finding a parameter and a field of\n","coefficients.

The field of coefficients is the residue field of the valuation, and\n","it is given in section 5.\n","  The constructions given in these sections are not effective in the general\n","case, because we need either to use the Zorn's lemma or to know explicitly a\n","section $\\sigma$ of the natural homomorphism $R_v\\to\\d$ between the ring and\n","the residue field of the valuation $v$.\n","  However, as a consequence of this construction, in section 7, we prove that\n","$k((\\X))$ can be embedded into a field $L((\\Y))$, where the {\\em ``extended\n","valuation'' is as close as possible to the usual order function}.\n","Let $v$ be a rank-one discrete valuation of the field $k((\\X))$.

We find: (i) our data allow for a robust\n","merger fraction to be provided for a single redshift bin centered at z=0.6.\n","(ii) Merger fractions have low values: f_m = 0.045 for M_B <= -20 galaxies, and\n","f_m = 0.031 for M_Ks <= -23.5 galaxies. And, (iii) failure to address the\n","effects of the observational errors leads to overestimating f_m by factors of\n","10%-60%. Combining our results with those on literature, and parameterizing the\n","merger fraction evolution as f_m(z) = f_m(0)(1+z)^m, we obtain that m = 2.9 +-\n","0.8, and f_m(0) = 0.012 +- 0.004$.

It is found that the degeneracy between neutrino\n","parameters and dark energy parameters is significantly reduced by incorporating\n","21 cm lensing. The combination of galaxy and 21 cm lensing could constrain the\n","sum of the neutrino masses to within ~ 0.04 eV and the number of species to\n","within ~ 0.1. This is an improvement of a factor of 2.6 in mass and 1.3 in\n","number over a galaxy lensing survey alone. This includes marginalizing over an\n","11 parameter cosmological model with a two parameter model for the dark energy\n","equation of state. If the dark energy equation of state is held fixed at w =\n","p/\\rho=-1 the constraints improve to ~0.03 eV and 0.04. These forecasted errors\n","depend critically on the fraction of sky that can be surveyed in redshifted 21\n","cm emission (25% is assumed here) and the redshift of reionization ($z=7$ is\n","assumed here). It is also found that neutrinos with masses too small to be\n","detected in the data could none the less cause a significant bias in the\n","measured dark energy equation of state.\n","In this paper, we study the effects of instrumental systematics on the\n","reconstruction of the deflection angle power spectrum from weak lensing of\n","Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization observations. We\n","consider seven types of effects which are related to known instrumental\n","systematics: calibration, rotation, pointing, spin-flip, monopole leakage,\n","dipole leakage and quadrupole leakage. These effects can be characterized by 11\n","distortion fields. Each of these systematic effects can mimic the effective\n","projected matter power spectrum and hence contaminate the lensing\n","reconstruction. To demonstrate the effect of these instrumental systematics, we\n","consider two types of experiments, one with a detector noise level for\n","polarization of 9.6 uK-arcmin and FWHM of 8.0', typical of upcoming ground and\n","balloon-based CMB experiments, and a CMBPol-like instrument with a detector\n","noise level for polarization of 2.0 uK-arcmin and FWHM of 4.0', typical of\n","future space-based CMB experiments. For each systematics, we consider various\n","choices of coherence scale. Among all the 11 systematic parameters, rotation\n","and monopole leakage place the most stringent requirements, while quadrupole\n","leakage, pointing error, and calibration are among the least demanding. The\n","requirements from lensing extraction are about 1-2 orders of magnitude less\n","stringent than the requirements to measure the primordial B-modes with\n","inflationary energy scale of 1.0*10^{16} GeV.

We\n","apply three cases for ionization conditions: Fully neutral, fully reionized,\n","and a patchy model based on the flux from the nearest galaxy. We find that our\n","simulations broadly fit available z~5-6 IGM metal-line data, although all\n","observations cannot be accommodated with a single ionization condition.\n","Variations in O I absorbers among sight lines seen by Becker et al. (2006)\n","suggest significant neutral IGM patches down to z~6. Strong C IV absorbers at\n","z~6 may be the result of ionization by their parent galaxy. Our outflows have\n","typical speeds of ~200 km/s and mass loading factors of ~6. Such high mass\n","loading is critical for enriching the IGM to the observed levels while\n","curtailing star formation to match the observed z~6 rest-frame UV luminosity\n","function. The volume filling factor of metals increases during this epoch, but\n","only reaches ~1% for Z>10^(-3) Zsolar by z=5. C IV is an ideal tracer of IGM\n","metals at z~5-6, with dropping global ionization fractions to either higher or\n","lower redshifts. This results in a strongly increasing global Omega(C IV) from\n","z=8->5, in contrast to its relative constancy from z=5->2. Our simulations do\n","not support widespread early IGM enrichment from e.g. Pop III stars.

Aims: Grain surface and\n","gas phase formation of HD and H2 is investigated to assess the importance of\n","trace amounts of dust, 10^{-5}-10^{-3} Zo, in the production of HD and H2.\n","Methods: We consider carbonaceous and silicate grains and include both\n","physisorption and chemisorption, tunneling, and realistic grain surface\n","barriers. We find, for a collapsing gas cloud environment with coupled chemical\n","and thermal balance, that dust abundances as small as 10^{-5} solar lead to a\n","strong boost in the H2 formation rate due to surface reactions. As a result of\n","this enhancement in H2, HD is formed more efficiently in the gas phase through\n","the D+ + H2 reaction. Direct formation of HD on dust grains cannot compete well\n","with this gas phase process for dust temperatures below 150 K. We also derive\n","up-to-date analytic fitting formulae for the grain surface formation of H2 and\n","HD, including the different binding energies of H and D. Results: Grain surface\n","reactions are crucial to the availability of H2 and HD in very metal-poor\n","environments. Above metallicities of 10^{-5} solar, the grain surface route\n","dominates the formation of H2, which in turn, drives the formation of HD in the\n","gas phase. At dust temperatures above 150 K, laboratory experiments and\n","theoretical modelling suggest that H2 formation on grains is suppressed while\n","HD formation on grains is not.\n","We use a combination of a cosmological N-body simulation of the concordance\n","Lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) paradigm and a semi-analytic model of galaxy\n","formation to investigate the spin development of central supermassive black\n","holes (BHs) and its relation to the BH host galaxy properties. In order to\n","compute BH spins, we use the alpha-model of Shakura & Sunyaev and consider the\n","King et al. warped disc alignment criterion. The orientation of the accretion\n","disc is inferred from the angular momentum of the source of accreted material,\n","which bears a close relationship to the large-scale structure in the\n","simulation. We find that the final BH spin depends almost exclusively on the\n","accretion history and only weakly on the warped disc alignment. The main\n","mechanisms of BH spin-up are found to be gas cooling processes and disc\n","instabilities, a result that is only partially compatible with Monte-Carlo\n","models where the main spin-up mechanisms are major mergers and disc\n","instabilities; the latter results are reproduced when implementing randomly\n","oriented accretion discs in our model. Regarding the BH population, we find\n","that more massive BHs, which are hosted by massive ellipticals, have higher\n","spin values than less-massive BHs, hosted by spiral galaxies. We analyse\n","whether gas accretion rates and BH spins can be used as tracers of the radio\n","loudness of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the current\n","observational indications of an increasing trend of radio-loud AGN fractions\n","with stellar and BH mass can be easily obtained when placing lower limits on\n","the BH spin, with a minimum influence from limits on the accretion rates; a\n","model with random accretion disc orientations is unable to reproduce this\n","trend. (ABRIDGED)\n","Deep near-infrared imaging surveys allow us to select and study distant\n","galaxies in the rest-frame optical, and have transformed our understanding of\n","the early Universe.

When we include higher redshift\n","observational probes, such as measurements of the linear growth factors,\n","Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest (\\lya), this limit improves\n","significantly and becomes $\\Omega_{\\rm EDE}(z_{\\rm lss})<1.4\\times10^{-3}$ (95%\n","C.L.).

In this case, the constraints on the amount of early dark\n","energy at the last scattering surface improve by a factor ten, when compared to\n","present constraints. We also discuss the impact on the parameter $\\gamma$, the\n","growth rate index, which describes the growth of structures in standard and in\n","modified gravity models.\n","A review of the development of the concept of dark matter is given. I begin\n","the review with the description of the discovery of the mass paradox in our\n","Galaxy and in clusters of galaxies. In mid 1970s the amount of observational\n","data was sufficient to suggest the presence of a massive and invisible\n","population around galaxies and in clusters of galaxies. The nature of the dark\n","population was not clear at that time, but the hypotheses of stellar as well as\n","of gaseous nature of the new population had serious difficulties. These\n","difficulties disappeared when non-baryonic nature of dark matter was suggested\n","in early 1980s. In addition to the presence of Dark Matter, recent observations\n","suggest the presence of Dark Energy, which together with Dark Matter and\n","ordinary baryonic matter makes the total matter/energy density of the Universe\n","equal to the critical cosmological density. There are various hypothesis as for\n","the nature of the dark matter particles, and generally some form of weakly\n","interactive massive particles (WIMPs) are strongly favored. Both Dark Matter\n","and Dark Energy are the greatest challenges for modern physics since their\n","nature is unknown.\n","The amplitude of cosmological density fluctuations, sigma_8, has been studied\n","and estimated by analysing many cosmological observations. The values of the\n","estimates vary considerably between the various probes. However, different\n","estimators probe the value of sigma_8 in different cosmological scales and do\n","not take into account the nonlinear evolution of the parameter at late times.\n","We show that estimates of the amplitude of cosmological density fluctuations\n","derived from cosmic flows are systematically higher than those inferred at\n","early epochs from the CMB because of nonlinear evolution at later times. We\n","discuss the past and future evolution of linear and nonlinear perturbations,\n","derive corrections to the value of sigma_8 and compare amplitudes after\n","accounting for these differences.\n","We use a complete and uniform sample of almost half a million galaxies from\n","the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to characterise the distribution of stellar mass\n","in the low-redshift Universe. Galaxy abundances are well determined over almost\n","four orders of magnitude in stellar mass, and are reasonably but not perfectly\n","fit by a Schechter function with characteristic stellar mass m* = 6.7 x 10^10\n","M_sun and with faint-end slope \\alpha = -1.155. For a standard cosmology and a\n","standard stellar Initial Mass Function, only 3.5% of the baryons in the\n","low-redshift Universe are locked up in stars. The projected autocorrelation\n","function of stellar mass is robustly and precisely determined for r_p < 30\n","Mpc/h. Over the range 10 kpc/kpc < r_p < 10 Mpc/h it is extremely well\n","represented by a power law. The corresponding three-dimensional autocorrelation\n","function is \\xi*(r) = (r/6.1 Mpc/h)^{-1.84}. Relative to the dark matter, the\n","bias of the stellar mass distribution is approximately constant on large\n","scales, but varies by a factor of five for r_p < 1 Mpc/h. This behaviour is\n","approximately but not perfectly reproduced by current models for galaxy\n","formation in the concordance LCDM cosmology. Detailed comparison suggests that\n","a fluctuation amplitude \\sigma_8 ~ 0.8 is preferred to the somewhat larger\n","value adopted in the Millennium Simulation models with which we compare our\n","data. This comparison also suggests that observations of stellar mass\n","autocorrelations as a function of redshift might provide a powerful test for\n","the nature of Dark Energy.\n","Measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak in the\n","redshift-space correlation function yield the angular diameter distance D_A(z)\n","and the Hubble parameter H(z) as a function of redshift, constraining the\n","properties of dark energy and space curvature. We discuss the perturbations\n","introduced in the galaxy correlation function by gravitational lensing through\n","the effect of magnification bias and its cross-correlation with the galaxy\n","density. At the BAO scale, gravitational lensing adds a small and slowly\n","varying component to the galaxy correlation function and does not change its\n","shape significantly, through which the BAO peak is measured. The relative shift\n","in the position of the BAO peak caused by gravitational lensing in the\n","angle-averaged correlation function is 10^-4 at z=1, rising to 10^-3 at z=2.5.\n","Lensing effects are stronger near the line-of-sight, however the relative peak\n","shift increases only to 10^-3.3 and 10^-2.4 at z=1 and z=2.5, when the galaxy\n","correlation is averaged within 5 degrees of the line-of-sight (containing only\n","0.4% of the galaxy pairs in a survey). Furthermore, the lensing contribution\n","can be measured separately and subtracted from the observed correlation at the\n","BAO scale.\n","[abridged] The First Stars in the Universe form out of pristine primordial\n","gas clouds that have been radiatively cooled to a few hundreds of degrees\n","Kelvin either via molecular or atomic (Lyman-Alpha) hydrogen lines. This\n","primordial mode of star formation is eventually quenched once radiative and/or\n","chemical (metal enrichment) feedbacks mark the transition to Population II\n","stars. In this paper we present a model for the formation rate of Population\n","III stars based on Press-Schechter modeling coupled with analytical recipes for\n","gas cooling and radiative feedback. Our model also includes a novel treatment\n","for metal pollution based on self-enrichment due to a previous episode of\n","Population III star formation in progenitor halos. With this model we derive\n","the star formation history of Population III stars, their contribution to the\n","re-ionization of the Universe and the time of the transition from Population\n","III star formation in minihalos to that in more massive halos where atomic\n","hydrogen cooling is also possible. We consider a grid of models highlighting\n","the impact of varying the values for the free parameters used, such as star\n","formation and feedback efficiency. The most critical factor is the assumption\n","that only one Population III star is formed in a halo. In this scenario, metal\n","free stars contribute only to a minor fraction of the total number of photons\n","required to re-ionize the universe. In addition, metal free star formation is\n","primarily located in minihalos and chemically enriched halos become the\n","dominant locus of star formation very early in the life of the Universe, at\n","redshift z~25. If instead multiple metal free stars are allowed to form out of\n","a single halo, then there is an overall boost of Population III star formation,\n","with a consequent significant contribution to the re-ionizing radiation budget.\n","The observables of the perturbed universe, CMB anisotropy and large\n","structures, depend on a set of cosmological parameters, as well as, the assumed\n","nature of primordial perturbations. In particular, the shape of the primordial\n","power spectrum (PPS) is, at best, a well motivated assumption. It is known that\n","the assumed functional form of the PPS in cosmological parameter estimation can\n","affect the best fit parameters and their relative confidence limits. In this\n","paper, we demonstrate that a specific assumed form actually drives the best fit\n","parameters into distinct basins of likelihood in the space of cosmological\n","parameters where the likelihood resists improvement via modifications to the\n","PPS. The regions where considerably better likelihoods are obtained allowing\n","free form PPS lie outside these basins. In the absence of a preferred model of\n","inflation, this raises a concern that current cosmological parameters estimates\n","are strongly prejudiced by the assumed form of PPS. Our results strongly\n","motivate approaches toward simultaneous estimation of the cosmological\n","parameters and the shape of the primordial spectrum from upcoming cosmological\n","data. It is equally important for theorists to keep an open mind towards early\n","universe scenarios that produce features in the PPS.\n","In studies of the environmental dependence of structure formation, the large\n","scale environment is often thought of as providing an effective background\n","cosmology: e.g. the formation of structure in voids is expected to be just like\n","that in a less dense universe with appropriately modified Hubble and\n","cosmological constants. However, in the excursion set description of structure\n","formation which is commonly used to model this effect, no explicit mention is\n","made of the effective cosmology. Rather, this approach uses the spherical\n","evolution model to compute an effective linear theory growth factor, which is\n","then used to predict the growth and evolution of nonlinear structures. We show\n","that these approaches are, in fact, equivalent: a consequence of Birkhoff's\n","theorem. We speculate that this equivalence will not survive in models where\n","the gravitational force law is modified from an inverse square, potentially\n","making the environmental dependence of clustering a good test of such models.\n","In this paper we present a parameter estimation analysis of the polarization\n","and temperature power spectra from the second and third season of observations\n","with the QUaD experiment.

We also present a\n","surprisingly simple prescription for calculating dark energy equation of state\n","constraints in combination with supernova distances from JDEM.\n","The constraints on departures from general relativity (GR) at cosmological\n","length scales due to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data are discussed. The\n","departure from GR is measured by the ratio, parameterized as $1 +\\varpi_0 (1 +\n","z)^{-S}$, between the gravitational potentials conventionally appearing in the\n","geodesic equation and the Poisson equation. Current CMB data indicate\n","$\\varpi_0=1.67^{+3.07}_{-1.87}$ at the 2$\\sigma$ confidence level, while $S$\n","remains unconstrained. The departure from GR affects the lensing conversion of\n","E-mode into B-mode polarization. Hence, the lensing measurements from a future\n","CMBpol experiment should be able to improve the constraints to $\\varpi_0< 0.30$\n","for a fiducial $\\varpi_0=0$ model and independent of $S$.\n","A detailed analysis of gravitational slip, a new post-general relativity\n","cosmological parameter characterizing the degree of departure of the laws of\n","gravitation from general relativity on cosmological scales, is presented. This\n","phenomenological approach assumes that cosmic acceleration is due to new\n","gravitational effects; the amount of spacetime curvature produced per unit mass\n","is changed in such a way that a universe containing only matter and radiation\n","begins to accelerate as if under the influence of a cosmological constant.\n","Changes in the law of gravitation are further manifest in the behavior of the\n","inhomogeneous gravitational field, as reflected in the cosmic microwave\n","background, weak lensing, and evolution of large-scale structure. The new\n","parameter, $\\varpi_0$, is naively expected to be of order unity. However, a\n","multiparameter analysis, allowing for variation of all the standard\n","cosmological parameters, finds that $\\varpi_0 = 0.09^{+0.74}_{-0.59} (2\\sigma)$\n","where $\\varpi_0=0$ corresponds to a $\\Lambda$CDM universe under general\n","relativity. Future probes of the cosmic microwave background (Planck) and\n","large-scale structure (Euclid) may improve the limits by a factor of four.\n","Cosmological simulations of dark matter structures have shown that the\n","equilibrated dark matter structures have a fairly small angular momentum. It\n","appears from these N-body simulations that the radial profile of the angular\n","momentum has an almost universal behavior, even if the different dark matter\n","structures have experienced very different formation and merger histories. We\n","suggest a perturbed Jeans equation, which includes a rotational term. This is\n","done under a reasonable assumed form of the change in the distribution\n","function. By conjecturing that the (new) subdominant rotation term must be\n","proportional to the (old) dominant mass term, we find a clear connection, which\n","is in rather good agreement with the results of recent high resolution\n","simulations. We also present a new connection between the radial profiles of\n","the angular momentum and the velocity anisotropy, which is also in fair\n","agreement with numerical findings. Finally we show how the spin parameter\n","$\\lambda$ increases as a function of radius.\n","Abreg: We investigate the impact of polarized foreground emission on the\n","performances of future CMB experiments in measuring the tensor-to-scalar ratio\n","r. We design a component separation pipeline, based on the Smica method, aimed\n","at estimating r and the foreground contamination from the data with no prior\n","assumption on the frequency dependence or spatial distribution of the\n","foregrounds. We derive error bars accounting for the uncertainty on foreground\n","contribution. We use the current knowledge of galactic and extra-galactic\n","foregrounds as implemented in the Planck Sky Model (PSM), to build simulations\n","of the sky emission for various experimental setups. Our method, permits us to\n","detect r = 0.1 at more than 3 sigma from B-modes only with Planck data, and r =\n","0.001 at 6 sigma for the most ambitious designs of the future EPIC probe. We\n","find that all-sky experiments permit a proper measurement of the reionization\n","bump despite the large scale foreground emission and are nearly insensitive to\n","contamination from point sources and lensing if their statistical contribution\n","can be modelled accurately.

Our results do not significantly\n","depend on the overall level and frequency dependence of the diffused foreground\n","model.\n","We derive a strong upper bound on the amount of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs)\n","that can still be present in the Universe.

Our finding\n","also helps to discriminate among the various production mechanisms of PBHs.\n","Moreover, we show that a star becomes overluminous before its disappearance\n","into a PBH for a time span independent of its mass, thereby providing a\n","characteristic observational signature of the considered scenario. We stress\n","that our result allows for the existence of stellar-mass black holes in a mass\n","range that is forbidden by standard stellar evolution.\n","We consider a PDE system comprising compressible hydrodynamics, flux-limited\n","diffusion radiation transport and chemical ionization kinetics in a\n","cosmologically-expanding universe.

This behavior is sometimes termed \"anti-hierarchical\", and\n","contrasted with the \"bottom-up\" assembly of the dark matter structures in Cold\n","Dark Matter models. In this paper we address three different kinds of\n","observational evidence that have been described as DS: the stellar mass\n","assembly, star formation rate and the ages of the stellar populations in local\n","galaxies. We compare a broad compilation of available data-sets with the\n","predictions of three different semi-analytic models of galaxy formation within\n","the Lambda-CDM framework. In the data, we see only weak evidence at best of DS\n","in stellar mass and in star formation rate. We find that, when observational\n","errors on stellar mass and SFR are taken into account, the models acceptably\n","reproduce the evolution of massive galaxies, over the entire redshift range\n","that we consider. However, lower mass galaxies are formed too early in the\n","models and are too passive at late times. Thus, the models do not correctly\n","reproduce the DS trend in stellar mass or the archaeological DS, while they\n","qualitatively reproduce the mass-dependent evolution of the SFR. We demonstrate\n","that these discrepancies are not solely due to a poor treatment of satellite\n","galaxies but are mainly connected to the excessively efficient formation of\n","central galaxies in high-redshift haloes with circular velocities ~100-200\n","km/s. [abridged]\n","Water masers are found in dense molecular clouds closely associated with\n","supermassive black holes in the centres of active galaxies. Based upon the\n","understanding of the local water maser luminosity function, it was expected\n","that masers at intermediate and high redshifts would be extremely rare, but\n","galaxies at redshifts z > 2 might be quite different from those found locally,\n","not least because of more frequent mergers and interaction events. Using\n","gravitational lensing as a tool to enable us to search higher redshifts than\n","would otherwise be possible, we have embarked on a survey of lensed galaxies,\n","looking for masers. Here we report the discovery of a water maser at redshift\n","2.64 in the dust- and gas-rich gravitationally lensed type 1 quasar MG\n","J0414+0534, which, with an isotropic luminosity of 10,000 L_solar, is twice as\n","luminous as the most powerful local water maser, and half that of the most\n","distant maser previously known. Using the locally-determined luminosity\n","function, the probability of finding a maser this luminous associated with any\n","single active galaxy is 10^{-6}. The fact that we saw such a maser in the first\n","galaxy we observed must mean that the volume densities and luminosities of\n","masers are higher at redshift 2.64.\n","We present g-z color and z-band surface brightness fluctuations (SBF)\n","measurements for 43 early-type galaxies in the Fornax cluster imaged with\n","HST/ACS. These are combined with measurements for Virgo cluster galaxies to\n","derive a revised, nonlinear calibration of the z-band SBF absolute magnitude as\n","a function of g-z.

The calibration procedure yields a precise relative\n","distance modulus for Fornax with respect to Virgo of 0.42+/-0.03 mag, or a\n","distance ratio 1.214 +/- 0.017. The resulting Fornax distance modulus is 31.51\n","+/-0.03 +/-0.15 mag, 20.0 +/-0.3 +/-1.4 Mpc, where the second set of error bars\n","reflects systematic uncertainty from our assumed Virgo distance of 16.5 Mpc.\n","The rms distance scatter for the early-type Fornax galaxies is\n","0.49^{+0.11}_{-0.15} Mpc, consistent with its compact appearance on the sky.\n","This translates to a depth scatter smaller than the intrinsic, or \"cosmic\",\n","scatter sigma_cosmic in the SBF calibration, unlike in Virgo. As a result, we\n","are able to place the first tight constraints on the value of sigma_cosmic,\n","finding 0.06 +/- 0.01 mag, with a firm upper limit of sigma_cosmic<0.08 mag, at\n","least for galaxies with g-z>1.02. We also present an alternative SBF\n","calibration based on the `fluctuation count' parameter Nbar, a proxy for galaxy\n","mass, which gives a consistent relative distance. Finally, we find no evidence\n","for systematic trends of the galaxy distances with position or velocity (e.g.,\n","no current infall); the Fornax cluster appears both compact and well\n","virialized.[abridged]\n","Using a representative sample of 911 central galaxies (CENs) from the SDSS\n","DR4 group catalogue, we study how the structure of the most massive members in\n","groups and clusters depend on (1) galaxy stellar mass (Mstar), (2) dark matter\n","halo mass of the host group (Mhalo), and (3) their halo-centric position. We\n","establish and thoroughly test a GALFIT-based pipeline to fit 2D Sersic models\n","to SDSS data. We find that the fitting results are most sensitive to the\n","background sky level determination and strongly recommend using the SDSS global\n","value. We find that uncertainties in the background translate into a strong\n","covariance between the total magnitude, half-light size (r50), and Sersic index\n","(n), especially for bright/massive galaxies. We find that n depends strongly on\n","Mstar for CENs, but only weakly or not at all on Mhalo. Less (more) massive\n","CENs tend to be disk (spheroid)-like over the full Mhalo range. Likewise, there\n","is a clear r50-Mstar relation for CENs, with separate slopes for disks and\n","spheroids. When comparing CENs with satellite galaxies (SATs), we find that low\n","mass (<10e10.75 Msun/h^2) SATs have larger median n than CENs of similar Mstar.\n","Low mass, late-type SATs have moderately smaller r50 than late-type CENs of the\n","same Mstar. However, we find no size differences between spheroid-like CENs and\n","SATs, and no structural differences between CENs and SATs matched in both mass\n","and colour. The similarity of massive SATs and CENs shows that this distinction\n","has no significant impact on the structure of spheroids. We conclude that Mstar\n","is the most fundamental property determining the basic structure of a galaxy.\n","The lack of a clear n-Mhalo relation rules out a distinct group mass for\n","producing spheroids, and the responsible morphological transformation processes\n","must occur at the centres of groups spanning a wide range of masses. (abridged)\n","This paper is a review of previous works on the stochastic background of\n","gravitational waves (SBGWs) which has been discussed in various peer-reviewed\n","journals and international conferences.

By comparing deep Hubble Space Telescope ACS imaging of\n","X-ray selected MACS survey clusters at z = 0.5 to the similarly selected LARCS\n","sample at z = 0.1 we find that the rest-frame d(U -V)/dV slope of the\n","colour-magnitude relation evolves with redshift which we attribute to the build\n","up of the red sequence over time.

In representative PDM and BDM models we find that\n","baryons contribute decisively to the evolution of the central region, leading\n","to an isothermal DM cusp, and to a flat DM density core -- the result of\n","heating by dynamical friction of the substructure during a quiescent evolution\n","epoch. This process ablates the cold gas from an embedded disk, cutting the\n","star formation rate by ~10, and heats up the spheroidal gas and stellar\n","components, triggering their expansion. The substructure is more resilient in\n","the presence of baryons. The disk which formed from inside-out as gas\n","dominated, is transformed into an intermediate Hubble type by z ~ 2 and to an\n","early type by z ~ 0.5, based on its gas contents and spheroidal-to-disk stellar\n","mass ratio. Only a relatively small ~20% fraction of DM particles in PDM and\n","BDM models are bound within the radius of maximal circular velocity in the halo\n","-- most of the DM particles perform larger radial excursions. We also find that\n","the fraction of baryons within the halo virial radius somewhat increases during\n","the major mergers and decreases during the minor mergers. The net effect\n","appears to be negligible. While the substructure is being tidally-disrupted,\n","mixing of its debris in the halo is not efficient and becomes even less so with\n","z. The streamers formed after z ~ 1 survive largely to the present time -- an\n","important implication for embedded disk evolution.\n","At the present time, SDSS early-type BCGs have larger Re than early-type\n","galaxies of similar L, whether these other objects are in the field, or are\n","satellites in clusters (Re ~ L for BCGs). At fixed M* and formation time, BCGs\n","at lower z are larger and have smaller velocity dispersions, i.e. Re increases\n","and sigma decreases with age. As a result, at z~0.25, corresponding to a\n","lookback time of order 3 Gyrs, BCGs are smaller than their lower z counterparts\n","by as much as 70% for the brightest BCGs: Re evolves as (1+z)^{0.85(Mr+21)}.\n","Qualitatively similar but weaker evolution in the sizes is also seen in the\n","bulk of the early-type population: at Mr<-22 Re evolves as (1+z)^{0.7(Mr+21)},\n","while at Mr>-22 the evolution is approximately (1+z)^{-0.7}, independent of Mr.\n","The sigma-L correlation also evolves: (1+z)^{-0.2(Mr+21)} at Mr < -22 (as for\n","the BCGs) and (1+z)^{0.2} for fainter galaxies. The Re- and sigma-M*\n","correlations yield consistent results. These trends are most easily understood\n","if early-type BCGs grew from many dry minor mergers rather than a few major\n","mergers. Only in such a scenario can BCGs be the descendents of the superdense\n","galaxies seen at z~2; major dry mergers, which increase the size in proportion\n","to the mass, cannot bring these galaxies onto the BCG Re-M* relation at z~0. We\n","also compared the ages and sizes of our early-type BCGs with satellites. BCGs\n","are larger than satellites of similar L or M* at the same redshift.

Finally,\n","we find that the mean satellite L is approximately independent of BCG L, in\n","agreement with recent predictions based on the L-dependence of clustering.\n","The most recent results and some of the open key questions on the evolution\n","of early-type galaxies are reviewed in the general cosmological context of\n","massive galaxy formation.\n","Milgrom's Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) provides an efficient way to\n","summarize phenomenology of galaxies which does not lean on the notion of dark\n","matter; it has great predictive power.

In recent\n","years such a theory, T$e$V$e$S, has emerged from the marriage of AQUAL with the\n","timelike vector field of Sanders. I discuss its structure and some of its\n","successes and shortcomings.\n","The existence of a cosmic neutrino background -- the analogue of the cosmic\n","microwave background -- is a fundamental prediction of standard big bang\n","cosmology. Up to now, the observational evidence for its existence is rather\n","indirect and rests entirely on cosmological observations of, e.g., the light\n","elemental abundances, the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, and\n","the large scale distribution of matter.

We use a new extraction technique based on the\n","well-determined positions of galaxies at shorter wavelengths to extract the 24\n","and 70 um flux densities of galaxies. Using a combination of photometric and\n","spectroscopic redshifts that exist for ~80% of the sources in our sample, we\n","are able to estimate the rest-frame luminosities of galaxies at 15um and 35um.\n","Then using a careful stacking analysis to validate the infrared bolometric\n","corrections we compute the infrared luminosity function in three redshift bins\n","z~0.55, z~0.85, and z~1.15. We find that the average infrared spectral energy\n","distribution of galaxies over the last 2/3 of the cosmic time is consistent\n","with that of local galaxies, although individual sources do present significant\n","scatter. We also measured both the bright and faint ends of the infrared\n","luminosity functions and find no evidence for a change in the slope of the\n","double power law used to characterize the luminosity function. The redshift\n","evolution of infrared luminous galaxies is consistent with pure luminosity\n","evolution proportional to (1+z)^3.6 up to z~1.3.

Using this formalism, we found that void\n","statistics for galaxy distributions can be obtained, to a very good\n","approximation, assuming galaxies to have the same clustering properties as\n","halos above a certain mass. We deducted a relationship between this mass and\n","that of halos with the same accumulated number density as the galaxies. We also\n","found that the dependence of void statistics on redshift is small.

However, the dependence of void statistics on sigma_8 and Omega_m h is\n","considerably larger, making them appropriate to develop tests to measure these\n","parameters. We have shown how to efficiently construct several of these tests\n","and discussed in detail the treatment of several observational effects. The\n","formalism presented here along with the observed statistics extracted from\n","current and future large galaxy redshift surveys will provide an independent\n","measurement of the relevant cosmological parameters. Combining these\n","measurements with those found using other methods will contribute to reduce\n","their uncertainties.\n","In this paper, we propose & implement on WMAP 5-year data, a model\n","independent approach of foreground power spectrum estimation for multifrequency\n","observations of CMB experiments. Recently a model independent approach of CMB\n","power spectrum estimation was proposed by Saha et al. 2006. This methodology\n","demonstrates that CMB power spectrum can be reliably estimated solely from WMAP\n","data without assuming any template models for the foreground components. In the\n","current paper, we extend this work to estimate the galactic foreground power\n","spectrum using the WMAP 5 year maps following a self contained analysis. We\n","apply the model independent method in harmonic basis to estimate the foreground\n","power spectrum and frequency dependence of combined foregrounds.

The simulations are three dimensional\n","extensions of two dimensional calculations reported by Jones & De Young (2005).\n","Initially spherical bubbles and briefly inflated spherical bubbles all with\n","radii a few times smaller than the intracluster medium (ICM) scale height were\n","followed as they rose through several ICM scale heights. Such bubbles quickly\n","evolve into a toroidal form that, in the absence of magnetic influences, is\n","stable against fragmentation in our simulations. This ring formation results\n","from (commonly used) initial conditions that cause ICM material below the\n","bubbles to drive upwards through the bubble, creating a vortex ring; that is,\n","hydrostatic bubbles develop into \"smoke rings\", if they are initially not very\n","much smaller or very much larger than the ICM scale height. Even modest ICM\n","magnetic fields with beta = P_gas/P_mag ~ 10^3 can influence the dynamics of\n","the bubbles, provided the fields are not tangled on scales comparable to or\n","smaller than the size of the bubbles. Quasi-uniform, horizontal fields with\n","initial beta ~ 10^2 bifurcated our bubbles before they rose more than about a\n","scale height of the ICM, and substantially weaker fields produced clear\n","distortions. On the other hand, tangled magnetic fields with similar, modest\n","strengths are generally less easily amplified by the bubble motions and are\n","thus less influential in bubble evolution. Inclusion of a comparably strong,\n","tangled magnetic field inside the initial bubbles had little effect on our\n","bubble evolution, since those fields were quickly diminished through expansion\n","of the bubble and reconnection of the initial field.\n","Previously Liao and Shuryak [\\textbf{Phys.

Since magnetic monopoles flow dispute the\n","dynamo action, it seems reasonable that their presence leads to a slow dynamo\n","action in the best hypothesis or a decay of the magnetic field. Hindmarsh et al\n","have computed the magnetic energy decay in the early universe as\n","${E}_{M}\\approx{t^{-0.5}}$, while in our slow dynamo case linearization of the\n","growth rate leads to a variation od magnetic energy of\n","${\\delta}{E}_{M}\\approx{t}$, due to the presence of magnetic monopoles.

These acausally expanding shells provide a\n","viable alternative to inflation for cosmological structure formation with the\n","same minimal number of parameters to characterize the initial fluctuations.\n","Causally expanding shells alone cannot fit present data. Hybrid models where\n","causal shells and inflation are mixed also provide good fits.\n","We study the properties of building blocks (BBs, i.e. accreted satellites)\n","and surviving satellites of present-day galaxies using the SAG semi-analytic\n","model of galaxy formation in the context of a concordance Lambda Cold Dark\n","Matter (LCDM) cosmology. We consider large numbers of DM halo merger trees\n","spanning a wide range of masses (~1x10^10 - 2.14x10^15 Msun). We find higher\n","metallicities for BBs with respect to surviving satellites, an effect produced\n","by the same processes behind the build-up of the mass-metallicity relation. We\n","prove that these metallicity differences arise from the higher peak height in\n","the density fluctuation field occupied by BBs and central galaxies which have\n","collapsed into a single object earlier than surviving satellites. BBs start to\n","form stars earlier, during the peak of the merger activity in LCDM, and\n","build-up half of their final stellar mass (measured at the moment of\n","disruption) up to four times faster than surviving satellites. Surviving\n","satellites keep increasing their stellar masses rather quiescently down to z~1.\n","The difference between the metallicities of satellites, BBs and central\n","galaxies depends on the host DM halo mass, in a way that can be used as a\n","further test for the concordance cosmology.\n","We use an analytic model to study how inhomogeneous hydrogen reionization\n","affects the temperature distribution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). During\n","this process, the residual energy of each ionizing photon is deposited in the\n","IGM as heat, increasing its temperature to 20,000-30,000 K; subsequent\n","expansion of the Universe then cools the gas. Because reionization most likely\n","proceeds from high to low densities, underdense voids are ionized last, have\n","less time to cool, and are (on average) warmer than mean-density gas\n","immediately after reionization is complete (an \"inverted\" equation of state).\n","  From this initial configuration, the low-density gas cools quickly and\n","eventually returns to a more normal equation of state. The rapidly evolving\n","temperature introduces systematic uncertainties in measurements of the ionizing\n","background at z~6. For example, late reionization implies rapid cooling, so\n","that the ionizing background would have to evolve even more rapidly at z ~5-6\n","than typically claimed. This degeneracy is difficult to disentangle, because\n","the Lyman-alpha forest probes only a narrow range in densities (over which the\n","gas is nearly isothermal). However, higher Lyman-series transitions probe wider\n","density ranges, sampling different effective temperatures, and offer a new way\n","to measure the IGM equation of state that should work where nearly saturated\n","absorption precludes other methods. This will help to separate evolution in\n","temperature from that in the ionizing background. While more detailed study\n","with hydrodynamic simulations is needed, we show that such measurements could\n","potentially distinguish early and late reionization using only a handful of\n","lines of sight.\n","The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) provides data on several hundred thousand\n","galaxies. Precise location of these galaxies in the sky, along with information\n","about their luminosities and line-of-sight (Doppler) velocities allows one to\n","construct a three-dimensional map of their location and estimate their\n","line-of-sight velocity dispersion. This information, in principle, allows one\n","to test dynamical gravity models, specifically models of satellite galaxy\n","velocity dispersions near massive hosts. A key difficulty is the separation of\n","true satellites from interlopers. We sidestep this problem by not attempting to\n","derive satellite galaxy velocity dispersions from the data, but instead\n","incorporate an interloper background into the mathematical models and compare\n","the result to the actual data. We find that due to the presence of interlopers,\n","it is not possible to exclude several gravitational theories on the basis of\n","the SDSS data.\n","We analyze sensitive, high-dynamic-range, observations to search for\n","extended, diffuse, radio emission in relaxed and cool-core galaxy clusters. We\n","performed deep 1.4 GHz Very Large Array observations, of A1068, A1413, A1650,\n","A1835, A2029, and complemented our dataset with archival observations of\n","Ophiuchus. We find that, in the central regions of A1835, A2029, and Ophiuchus,\n","the dominant radio galaxy is surrounded by diffuse low-brightness radio\n","emission that takes the form of a mini-halo. We detect no diffuse emission in\n","A1650, at a surface brightness level of the other mini-halos. We find low\n","significance indications of diffuse emission in A1068 and A1413, although to be\n","classified as mini-halos they would require further investigation, possibly\n","with data of higher signal-to-noise ratio. In the Appendix, we report on the\n","serendipitous detection of a giant radio galaxy with a total spatial extension\n","of ~1.6 Mpc.\n","We recently performed a study of a sample of relaxed, cooling core galaxy\n","clusters with deep Very Large Array observations at 1.4 GHz.

Here we present the results of the analysis of the extended diffuse\n","radio emission in these mini-halos. In order to investigate the morphological\n","properties of the diffuse radio emission in clusters of galaxies we propose to\n","fit their azimuthally averaged brightness profile with an exponential,\n","obtaining the central brightness and the e-folding radius from which the radio\n","emissivity can be calculated. We investigate the radio properties of the\n","mini-halos in A1835, A2029, and Ophiuchus in comparison with the radio\n","properties of a representative sample of mini-halos and halos already known in\n","the literature. We find that radio halos can have quite different length-scales\n","but their emissivity is remarkably similar from one halo to the other. In\n","contrast, mini-halos span a wide range of radio emissivity. Some of them, like\n","the Perseus mini-halos, are characterized by a radio emissivity which is more\n","than 100 times greater than that of radio halos. On the other hand, the new\n","mini-halos in cooling core clusters analyzed in this work, namely A2029,\n","Ophiuchus, and A1835, have a radio emissivity which is much more typical of\n","halos in merging clusters rather than similar to that of the other mini-halos\n","previously known.\n","At present, dwarf spheroidal galaxies satellites of the Milky Way may\n","represent the best astrophysical objects for dark matter (DM) searches with\n","gamma-ray telescopes. They present the highest mass-to-light ratios known in\n","the Universe.

The picture has become even better\n","with the recent discovery of new dwarfs. These new objects are expected to\n","yield even higher DM annihilation fluxes, since most of them are nearer than\n","the previously known dwarfs and are even more DM dominated systems.

Using the framework of Maximum A\n","Posteriori inversion, it aims at recovering the full-sky convergence map from\n","surveys with masks. It proceeds in two steps: CCD images of crowded galactic\n","fields are deblurred using automated edge-preserving deconvolution; once the\n","reduced shear is estimated, the convergence map is also inverted via an edge-\n","preserving method. For the deblurring, it is found that when the observed field\n","is crowded, this gain can be quite significant for realistic ground-based\n","surveys when both positivity and edge-preserving penalties are imposed during\n","the iterative deconvolution. For the convergence inversion, the quality of the\n","reconstruction is investigated on noisy maps derived from the horizon N-body\n","simulation, with and without Galactic cuts, and quantified using one-point\n","statistics, power spectra, cluster counts, peak patches and the skeleton. It is\n","found that the reconstruction is able to interpolate and extrapolate within the\n","Galactic cuts/non-uniform noise; its sharpness-preserving penalization avoids\n","strong biasing near the clusters of the map; it reconstructs well the shape of\n","the PDF as traced by its skewness and kurtosis; the geometry and topology of\n","the reconstructed map is close to the initial map as traced by the peak patch\n","distribution and the skeleton's differential length; the two-points statistics\n","of the recovered map is consistent with the corresponding smoothed version of\n","the initial map; the distribution of point sources is also consistent with the\n","corresponding smoothing, with a significant improvement when edge preserving\n","prior is applied.

Here, I begin by describing some of my work on radio\n","galaxies as a modified standard yardstick and go on to describe\n","model-independent studies of the accelerating universe and the properties of\n","the dark energy. During the course of these studies, I came upon interesting\n","ways to study the spin and other properties of supermassive black holes, some\n","of which are briefly mentioned.\n","We study the flux and the angular power spectrum of gamma-rays produced by\n","Dark Matter (DM) annihilations in the Milky Way (MW) and in extra-galactic\n","halos. The annihilation signal receives contributions from: a) the smooth MW\n","halo, b) resolved and unresolved substructures in the MW, c) external DM halos\n","at all redshifts, including d) their substructures. Adopting a self-consistent\n","description of local and extra-galactic substructures, we show that the\n","annihilation flux from substructures in the MW dominates over all the other\n","components for angles larger than O(1) degrees from the Galactic Center, unless\n","an extreme prescription is adopted for the substructures concentration. We also\n","compute the angular power spectrum of gamma-ray anisotropies and find that, for\n","an optimistic choice of the particle physics parameters, an interesting\n","signature of DM annihilations could soon be discovered by the Fermi LAT\n","satellite at low multipoles, l<100, where the dominant contribution comes from\n","MW substructures with mass M>10^4 solar masses. For the substructures models we\n","have adopted, we find that the contribution of extra-galactic annihilations is\n","instead negligible at all scales.\n","The measurement of proper motions in CSOs is a powerful tool to determine the\n","dynamical evolution of the newly born extragalactic radio sources. We observed\n","3 CSOs with the VLBA in 2004 and in 2006 to monitor changes in their structure\n","and measure the separation velocity of the hot spots. It is important to\n","increase the size of the samples of CSOs with measured expansion velocity to\n","test the existance of frustrated objects, and put stringent constraints on the\n","current models. We found for all the three objects observed a transverse motion\n","of the hotspots, and we suggest as the more likey explanation a precession in\n","the jet axis. This behaviour likely inhibits or at least slows down the radio\n","source growth because the head of the hotspot continuously hits new regions of\n","the ISM. Therefore these radio sources may represent an old population of\n","GPS/CSOs.\n","We present a sample of sources with convex radio spectra peaking at\n","frequencies above a few GHz, known as \"High Frequency Peakers\" (HFPs). A\n","\"bright\" sample with a flux density limit of 300 mJy at 5 GHz has been\n","presented by Dallacasa et al. (2000). Here we present the \"faint\" sample with\n","flux density between 50 and 300 mJy at 5GHz, restricted to the area around the\n","North Galactic Cap, where the FIRST catalogue is available. The candidates have\n","been observed with the VLA at several frequencies ranging from 1.4 to 22 GHz,\n","in order to derive a simultaneous radio spectrum. The final list of confirmed\n","HFP sources consists of 61 objects.\n","We explore some properties of twin kilohertz quasiperiodic oscillations\n","(QPOs) in a simple toy-model consisting of two oscillation modes coupled by a\n","general nonlinear force. We examine resonant effects by slowly varying the\n","values of the tunable, and nearly commensurable, eigenfrequencies. The behavior\n","of the actual oscillation frequencies and amplitudes during a slow transition\n","through the 3:2 resonance is examined in detail and it is shown that both are\n","significantly affected by the nonlinearities in the governing equations. In\n","particular, the amplitudes of oscillations reflect a resonant exchange of\n","energy between the modes, as a result the initially weaker mode may become\n","dominant after the transition. We note that a qualitatively similar behavior\n","has been recently reported in several neutron star sources by Torok (2008,\n","arXiv:0812.4751), who found that the difference of amplitudes in neutron star\n","twin peak QPOs changes sign as the observed frequency ratio of the QPOs passes\n","through the value 3:2.\n","Forthcoming photometric redshift surveys should provide an accurate probe of\n","the acoustic peak in the two-point galaxy correlation function, in the form of\n","angular clustering of galaxies within a given shell in redshift space. We\n","investigate the form of the anticipated signal, quantifying the distortions\n","that arise due to projection effects, and in particular explore the validity of\n","applying the Limber approximation. A single-integral prescription is presented,\n","which provides an alternative to Limber's equation, and produces a\n","significantly improved prediction in the regime of interest.\n","  The position of the acoustic peak within the angular correlation function\n","relates to the angular diameter distance to the far side of the redshift bin.\n","Thicker redshift bins therefore shift comoving features towards smaller angular\n","scales. As a result, the value of the photometric redshift error acquires a\n","greater significance, particularly at lower redshifts. In order to recover the\n","dark energy equation of state to a level of 1%, we find the total redshift\n","dispersion must be determined to within \\Delta \\sigma_z ~ 10^-3, which may\n","prove challenging to achieve in practice.\n","We report VRI CCD observations of nine Cepheids in the South Polar (Sculptor)\n","Group spiral galaxy NGC 0247.

To this aim, the\n","luminosity (or isotropic emitted energy) of a GRB at redshift z must be\n","evaluated from a correlation with a distance independent quantity so that one\n","can then solve for the luminosity distance D_L(z) and hence the distance\n","modulus mu(z). Averaging over five different two parameters correlations and\n","using a fiducial cosmological model to calibrate them, Schaefer (2007) has\n","compiled a sample of 69 GRBs with measured mu(z) which has since then been\n","widely used to constrain cosmological parameters.

We estimate the true likelihood for a fiducial cosmological\n","model from a large set of ray-tracing simulations and investigate the impact of\n","non-Gaussianity on cosmological parameter estimation. We investigate how odd\n","the recently reported very low value of $\\sigma_8$ really is as derived from\n","the \\textit{Chandra} Deep Field South (CDFS) using cosmic shear by taking the\n","non-Gaussianity of the likelihood into account as well as the possibility of\n","biases coming from the way the CDFS was selected.\n","  We find that the cosmic shear likelihood is significantly non-Gaussian.

Nevertheless, our study shows a clear tendency, which is the same for\n","all bands studied, that favours a luminosity evolution where galaxies were\n","brighter in the past for the same rotation velocity.

We compare gRSs with the regular-sized radio sources in radio and\n","optical bands, yielding the following results: 1. The fraction of broad line\n","objects among gRSs with high excitation spectrum is the same as for the RSs\n","from isotropic samples. According to Unified Scheme this leads to the isotropic\n","angle distribution of gRSs jets, thus gRSs cannot be characterized as objects\n","with jets lying in the plane of sky. 2. gRSs do not differ from normal sized\n","RSs in apparent asymmetry distribution of their extended radio components\n","(ERC). However the fact that asymmetry distributions for gRSs and giant radio\n","quasars (gQSS) are essentially the same leads within the Unification Scheme to\n","the conclusion that the origin of this asymmetry is in the non-uniform\n","environment. 3. The richness of the environment for gRSs is the same as for\n","normal sized RSs. This contradicts the opinion that the low density of the\n","environment is the single reason for gRSs formation. 4. About 10% of FRII RSs\n","have by order of magnitude longer lifetimes and eventually evolve to gRSs. 5.\n","The observed relative quantity of radio quasars in gRSs population (~0.1) can\n","be interpreted as the presence of long-living population of radio loud QSSs as\n","~0.1 of all radio quasars.\n","Dynamical studies of local ETGs and the Fundamental Plane point to a strong\n","dependence of M/L ratio on luminosity (and stellar mass) with a relation of the\n","form $M/L \\propto L^{\\gamma}$. The \"tilt\" $\\gamma$ may be caused by various\n","factors, including stellar population properties, IMF, rotational support,\n","luminosity profile non-homology and dark matter (DM) fraction.

We take particular care in estimating the stellar\n","masses, using a general star formation history, and comparing different\n","population synthesis models. We find that the stellar M/L contributes little to\n","the tilt. We estimate the total M/L using simple Jeans dynamical models, and\n","find that adopting accurate luminosity profiles is important but does not\n","remove the need for an additional tilt component, which we ascribe to DM. We\n","survey trends of the DM fraction within one effective radius, finding it to be\n","roughly constant for galaxies fainter than $M_B \\sim -20.5$, and increasing\n","with luminosity for the brighter galaxies; we detect no significant differences\n","among S0s and fast- and slow-rotating ellipticals. We construct simplified\n","cosmological mass models and find general consistency, where the DM transition\n","point is caused by a change in the relation between luminosity and effective\n","radius. A more refined model with varying galaxy star formation efficiency\n","suggests a transition from total mass profiles (including DM) of faint galaxies\n","distributed similarly to the light, to near-isothermal profiles for the bright\n","galaxies. These conclusions are sensitive to various systematic uncertainties\n","which we investigate in detail, but are consistent with the results of dynamics\n","studies at larger radii.\n","We propose a novel technique to refine the modelling of galaxy clusters mass\n","distribution using gravitational lensing. The idea is to combine the strengths\n","of both \"parametric\" and \"non-parametric\" methods to improve the quality of the\n","fit.

There is a very high surface density of this\n","class of objects. This is consistent with a very steep slope of the faint end\n","of the luminosity function as has been inferred by other studies. This faint\n","population of galaxies is playing a central role in the early Universe. There\n","is evidence that this population is dominating the integrated star-formation\n","activity, responsible for the bulk of the ionizing photons at z~3 and likely\n","also responsible for the bulk of the enrichment of the intergalactic medium.\n","Assuming that neutrinos of non-zero rest mass dominate the mass density in\n","the universe, and also the mass density on the scale of clusters of galaxies,\n","one obtains the upper limit m < 20 eV/c^2 on their mass, independent of the\n","values of H_0 and q_0, and the lower limit m > 5 eV/c^2 independent of q_0 and\n","almost independent of H_0. If they are not to dominate the mass density on the\n","scale of binary galaxies and small groups of galaxies, one must have m < 14\n","eV/c2 independent of q0 and almost independent of H0. Going one step further,\n","we allow neutrinos to have different gravitational and inertial masses so that\n","r = gravitational / inertial mass.

We examine this interpretation using a\n","semi-analytic model of inhomogeneous HeII reionisation and high resolution\n","hydrodynamical simulations of the Lya forest. We instead find that a rapid\n","(\\Delta z ~ 0.2) boost to the IGM temperature (\\Delta T ~ 10^4 K) beginning at\n","z=3.4 produces a well understood and generic evolution in the Lya effective\n","optical depth, where a sudden reduction in the opacity is followed by a\n","gradual, monotonic recovery driven largely by adiabatic cooling in the low\n","density IGM. This behaviour is inconsistent with the narrow feature in the\n","observational data. If photo-heating during HeII reionisation is instead\n","extended over several redshift units, as recent theoretical studies suggest,\n","then the Lya opacity will evolve smoothly with redshift. We conclude that the\n","sharp dip observed in the Lya forest effective optical depth is instead most\n","likely due to a narrow peak in the hydrogen photo-ionisation rate around z=3.2,\n","and suggest that it may arise from the modulation of either reprocessed\n","radiation during HeII reionisation, or the opacity of Lyman limit systems.\n","Short GRBs are commonly thought to originate from the merging of double\n","compact object binaries but direct evidence for this scenario is still missing.\n","Optical observations of short GRBs allow us to measure redshifts, firmly\n","identify host galaxies, characterize their properties, and accurately localize\n","GRBs within them.

About half a day after the burst,\n","the optical afterglows of GRB 051227 and GRB 061006 present a decay\n","significatly steeper than in the X-rays. In the case of GRB 051227, the optical\n","decay is so steep that it likely indicates different emission mechanisms in the\n","two wavelengths ranges. The three hosts are blue, star forming galaxies at\n","moderate redshifts and with metallicities comparable to the Solar one. The\n","projected offsets of the optical afterglows from their host galaxies centers\n","span a wide range, but all afterglows lie within the light of their hosts and\n","present evidence for local absorption in their X-ray spectra.

We use a systematic mesoscale methodology, based on Dissipative\n","Particle Dynamics, which is capable of overcoming kinetic barriers, thus\n","capturing the dynamics of significantly larger systems over longer times than\n","considered before. Our results reveal that the relative hydrophobicity of the\n","poly-glutamine block as compared to the rest of the (proline-based) exon1\n","fragment, ignored to date, constitutes a major factor in the initiation of the\n","self-assembly process. We find that the assembly is governed by both the\n","concentration of exon1 and the length of the poly-glutamine stretch, with a low\n","length threshold for association even at the lowest volume fractions we\n","considered. Moreover, this self-association occurs irrespective of whether the\n","glutamine stretch is in random coil or hairpin configuration, leading to\n","spherical or cylindrical assemblies, respectively. We discuss the implications\n","of these results for reinterpretation of existing research within this context,\n","including that the routes towards aggregation of exon1 may be distinct to those\n","of the widely studied homopolymeric poly-glutamine peptides.\n","The molecular mechanism of the solvent motion that is required to instigate\n","the protein structural relaxation above a critical hydration level or\n","transition temperature has yet to be determined.

In this\n","Communication, we focus our results of hydration dynamics near a model protein\n","surface on the issue of how enzymatic activity is restored once a critical\n","hydration level is reached, and provide a hypothesis for the molecular\n","mechanism of the solvent motion that is required to trigger protein structural\n","relaxation when above the hydration transition.\n","We analyze the dependence of thermal denaturation transition and folding\n","rates of globular proteins on the number of amino acid residues, N. Using\n","lattice Go models we show that DeltaT/T_F ~ N^-1, where T_F is the folding\n","transition temperature and DeltaT is the folding transition width. This finding\n","is consistent with finite size effects expected for the systems undergoing a\n","phase transition from a disordered to an ordered phase. The dependence of the\n","folding rates k_F on N for lattice models and the dataset of 57 proteins and\n","peptides shows that k_F = k_F^0 exp(-CN^beta) provides a good fit, if 0 < beta\n","<= 2/3 and C is a constant. We find that k_F = k_F^0 exp(-1.1N^0.5) with k_F^0\n","=(0.4x10^-6 s)^-1 can estimate optimal protein folding rates to within an order\n","of magnitude in most cases. By using this fit for a set of proteins with\n","beta-sheet topology we find that k_F^0 is approximately equal to k_U^0, the\n","prefactor for unfolding rates. The maximum ratio of k_U^0/k_F^0 is 10 for this\n","class of proteins.\n","The asymmetry in the shapes of folded and unfolded states are probed using\n","two parameters, one being a measure of the sphericity and the other that\n","describes the shape. For the folded states, whose interiors are densely packed,\n","the radii of gyration (Rg) and these two parameters are calculated using the\n","coordinates of the experimentally determined structures. Although Rg scales as\n","expected for maximally compact structures, the distributions of the shape\n","parameters show that there is considerable asymmetry in the shapes of folded\n","structures. The degree of asymmetry is greater for proteins that form\n","oligomers. Analysis of the two- and three-body contacts in the native\n","structures shows that the presence of near equal number of contacts between\n","backbone and side-chains and between side-chains gives rise to dense packing.\n","We suggest that proteins with relatively large values of shape parameters can\n","tolerate volume mutations without greatly affecting the network of contacts or\n","their stability. To probe shape characteristics of denatured states we have\n","developed a model of a WW-like domain. The shape parameters, which are\n","calculated using Langevin simulations, change dramatically in the course of\n","coil to globule transition. Comparison of the values of shape parameters\n","between the globular state and the folded state of WW domain shows that both\n","energetic (especially dispersion in the hydrophobic interactions) and steric\n","effects are important in determining packing in proteins.\n","Instead of conformation states of single residues, refined conformation\n","states of quintuplets are proposed to reflect conformation correlation. Simple\n","hidden Markov models combining with sliding window scores are used for\n","predicting secondary structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. Since\n","the length of protein conformation segments varies in a narrow range, we ignore\n","the duration effect of the length distribution. The window scores for residues\n","are a window version of the Chou-Fasman propensities estimated under an\n","approximation of conditional independency. Different window widths are\n","examined, and the optimal width is found to be 17. A high accuracy about 70% is\n","achieved.\n","Is protein secondary structure primarily determined by local interactions\n","between residues closely spaced along the amino acid backbone, or by non-local\n","tertiary interactions? To answer this question we have measured the entropy\n","densities of primary structure and secondary structure sequences, and the local\n","inter-sequence mutual information density. We find that the important\n","inter-sequence interactions are short ranged, that correlations between\n","neighboring amino acids are essentially uninformative, and that only 1/4 of the\n","total information needed to determine the secondary structure is available from\n","local inter-sequence correlations. Since the remaining information must come\n","from non-local interactions, this observation supports the view that the\n","majority of most proteins fold via a cooperative process where secondary and\n","tertiary structure form concurrently. To provide a more direct comparison to\n","existing secondary structure prediction methods, we construct a simple hidden\n","Markov model (HMM) of the sequences. This HMM achieves a prediction accuracy\n","comparable to other single sequence secondary structure prediction algorithms,\n","and can extract almost all of the inter-sequence mutual information. This\n","suggests that these algorithms are almost optimal, and that we should not\n","expect a dramatic improvement in prediction accuracy. However, local\n","correlations between secondary and primary structure are probably of\n","under-appreciated importance in many tertiary structure prediction methods,\n","such as threading.\n","The determination of the folding mechanisms of proteins is critical to\n","understand the topological change that can propagate Alzheimer and\n","Creutzfeld-Jakobs diseases, among others. The computational community has paid\n","considerable attention to this problem; however, the associated time scale,\n","typically on the order of milliseconds or more, represents a formidable\n","challenge. Ab initio protein folding from long molecular dynamics (MD)\n","simulations or ensemble dynamics is not feasible with ordinary computing\n","facilities and new techniques must be introduced. Here we present a detailed\n","study of the folding of a 16-residue beta-hairpin, described by a generic\n","energy model and using the activation-relaxation technique. From a total of 90\n","trajectories at 300 K, three folding pathways emerge. All involve a\n","simultaneous optimization of the complete hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding\n","interactions. The first two follow closely those observed by previous\n","theoretical studies. The third pathway, never observed by previous all-atom\n","folding, unfolding and equilibrium simulations, can be described as a reptation\n","move of one strand of the beta-sheet with respect to the other. This reptation\n","move indicates that non-native interactions can play a dominant role in the\n","folding of secondary structures. These results point to a more complex folding\n","picture than expected for a simple beta-hairpin.\n","Analytic estimates for the forces and free energy generated by bilayer\n","deformation reveal a compelling and intuitive model for MscL channel gating\n","analogous to the nucleation of a second phase. We argue that the competition\n","between hydrophobic mismatch and tension results in a surprisingly rich story\n","which can provide both a quantitative comparison to measurements of opening\n","tension for MscL when reconstituted in bilayers of different thickness and\n","qualitative insights into the function of the MscL channel and other\n","transmembrane proteins.\n","It is important to understand how protein folding and evolution influences\n","each other. Several studies based on entropy calculation correlating\n","experimental measurement of residue participation in folding nucleus and\n","sequence conservation have reached different conclusions. Here we report\n","analysis of conservation of folding nucleus using an evolutionary model\n","alternative to entropy based approaches. We employ a continuous time Markov\n","model of codon substitution to distinguish mutation fixed by evolution and\n","mutation fixed by chance. This model takes into account bias in codon\n","frequency, bias favoring transition over transversion, as well as explicit\n","phylogenetic information. We measure selection pressure using the ratio\n","$\\omega$ of synonymous vs. non-synonymous substitution at individual residue\n","site. The $\\omega$-values are estimated using the {\\sc Paml} method, a\n","maximum-likelihood estimator. Our results show that there is little correlation\n","between the extent of kinetic participation in protein folding nucleus as\n","measured by experimental $\\phi$-value and selection pressure as measured by\n","$\\omega$-value. In addition, two randomization tests failed to show that\n","folding nucleus residues are significantly more conserved than the whole\n","protein. These results suggest that at the level of codon substitution, there\n","is no indication that folding nucleus residues are significantly more conserved\n","than other residues. We further reconstruct candidate ancestral residues of the\n","folding nucleus and suggest possible test tube mutation studies of ancient\n","folding nucleus.\n","Many signalling functions in molecular biology require proteins bind to\n","substrates such as DNA in response to environmental signals such as the\n","simultaneous binding to a small molecule. Examples are repressor proteins which\n","may transmit information via a conformational change in response to the ligand\n","binding. An alternative entropic mechanism of ``allostery'' suggests that the\n","inducer ligand changes the intramolecular vibrational entropy not just the\n","static structure. We present a quantitative, coarse-grained model of entropic\n","allostery that suggests design rules for internal cohesive potentials in\n","proteins employing this effect. It also addresses the issue of how the signal\n","information to bind or unbind is transmitted through the protein. The model may\n","be applicable to a wide range of repressors and also to signalling in\n","transmembrane proteins.\n","How DNA repair enzymes find the relatively rare sites of damage is not known\n","in great detail. Recent experiments and molecular data suggest that the\n","individual repair enzymes do not work independently of each other, but rather\n","interact with each other through currents exchanged along DNA. A damaged site\n","in DNA hinders this exchange and this makes it possible to quickly free up\n","resources from error free stretches of DNA. Here the size of the speedup gained\n","from this current exchange mechanism is calculated and the characteristic\n","length and time scales are identified. In particular for Escherichia coli we\n","estimate the speedup to be 50000/N, where N is the number of repair enzymes\n","participating in the current exchange mechanism. Even though N is not exactly\n","known a speedup of order 10 is not entirely unreasonable. Furthermore upon over\n","expression of repair enzymes the detection time only varies as one over the\n","squareroot of N and not as 1/N. This behavior is of interest in assessing the\n","impact of stress full and radioactive environments on individual cell mutation\n","rates.\n","We study DNA adsorption and renaturation in a water-phenol two-phase system,\n","with or without shaking. In very dilute solutions, single-stranded DNA is\n","adsorbed at the interface in a salt-dependent manner. At high salt\n","concentrations the adsorption is irreversible. The adsorption of the\n","single-stranded DNA is specific to phenol and relies on stacking and hydrogen\n","bonding. We establish the interfacial nature of a DNA renaturation at a high\n","salt concentration. In the absence of shaking, this reaction involves an\n","efficient surface diffusion of the single-stranded DNA chains. In the presence\n","of a vigorous shaking, the bimolecular rate of the reaction exceeds the\n","Smoluchowski limit for a three-dimensional diffusion-controlled reaction. DNA\n","renaturation in these conditions is known as the Phenol Emulsion Reassociation\n","Technique or PERT. Our results establish the interfacial nature of PERT. A\n","comparison of this interfacial reaction with other approaches shows that PERT\n","is the most efficient technique and reveals similarities between PERT and the\n","renaturation performed by single-stranded nucleic acid binding proteins. Our\n","results lead to a better understanding of the partitioning of nucleic acids in\n","two-phase systems, and should help design improved extraction procedures for\n","damaged nucleic acids. We present arguments in favor of a role of phenol and\n","water-phenol interface in prebiotic chemistry. The most efficient renaturation\n","reactions (in the presence of condensing agents or with PERT) occur in\n","heterogeneous systems. This reveals the limitations of homogeneous approaches\n","to the biochemistry of nucleic acids. We propose a heterogeneous approach to\n","overcome the limitations of the homogeneous viewpoint.\n","Hydrophobicity is thought to be one of the primary forces driving the folding\n","of proteins. On average, hydrophobic residues occur preferentially in the core,\n","whereas polar residues tends to occur at the surface of a folded protein. By\n","analyzing the known protein structures, we quantify the degree to which the\n","hydrophobicity sequence of a protein correlates with its pattern of surface\n","exposure. We have assessed the statistical significance of this correlation for\n","several hydrophobicity scales in the literature, and find that the computed\n","correlations are significant but far from optimal. We show that this less than\n","optimal correlation arises primarily from the large degree of mutations that\n","naturally occurring proteins can tolerate. Lesser effects are due in part to\n","forces other than hydrophobicity and we quantify this by analyzing the surface\n","exposure distributions of all amino acids. Lastly we show that our database\n","findings are consistent with those found from an off-lattice hydrophobic-polar\n","model of protein folding.\n","The approach for the description of the DNA conformational transformations on\n","the mesoscopic scales in the frame of the double helix is presented. Due to\n","consideration of the joint motions of DNA structural elements along the\n","conformational pathways the models for different transformations may be\n","constructed in the unifying two-component form. One component of the model is\n","the degree of freedom of the elastic rod and another component -- the effective\n","coordinate of the conformational transformation. The internal and external\n","model components are interrelated, as it is characteristic for the DNA\n","structure organization. It is shown that the kinetic energy of the\n","conformational transformation of heterogeneous DNA may be put in homogeneous\n","form. In the frame of the developed approach the static excitations of the DNA\n","structure under the transitions between the stable states are found for\n","internal and external components. The comparison of the data obtained with the\n","experiment on intrinsic DNA deformability shows good qualitative agreement. The\n","conclusion is made that the found excitations in the DNA structure may be\n","classificated as the static conformational solitons.\n","Molecular combing is a powerful and simple method for aligning DNA molecules\n","onto a surface. Using this technique combined with fluorescence microscopy, we\n","observed that the length of lambda-DNA molecules was extended to about 1.6\n","times their contour length (unextended length, 16.2 micrometers) by the combing\n","method on hydrophobic polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) coated surfaces. The effects\n","of sodium and magnesium ions and pH of the DNA solution were investigated.\n","Interestingly, we observed force-induced melting of single DNA molecules.\n","Using a Brownian dynamics simulation, we numerically studied the interaction\n","of DNA with histone and proposed an octamer-rotation model to describe the\n","process of nucleosome formation. Nucleosome disruption under stretching was\n","also simulated. The theoretical curves of extension versus time as well as of\n","force versus extension are consistent with previous experimental results.\n","We propose a two-dimensional model for a complete description of the dynamics\n","of molecular motors, including both the processive movement along track\n","filaments and the dissociation from the filaments. The theoretical results on\n","the distributions of the run length and dwell time at a given ATP\n","concentration, the dependences of mean run length, mean dwell time and mean\n","velocity on ATP concentration and load are in good agreement with the previous\n","experimental results.\n","Kinesin motors have been studied extensively both experimentally and\n","theoretically. However, the microscopic mechanism of the processive movement of\n","kinesin is still an open question. In this paper, we propose a hand-over-hand\n","model for the processivity of kinesin, which is based on chemical, mechanical,\n","and electrical couplings. In the model the processive movement does not need to\n","rely on the two heads' coordination in their ATP hydrolysis and mechanical\n","cycles. Rather, the ATP hydrolyses at the two heads are independent. The much\n","higher ATPase rate at the trailing head than the leading head makes the motor\n","walk processively in a natural way, with one ATP being hydrolyzed per step. The\n","model is consistent with the structural study of kinesin and the measured\n","pathway of the kinesin ATPase. Using the model the estimated driving force of ~\n","5.8 pN is in agreements with the experimental results (5~7.5 pN). The\n","prediction of the moving time in one step (~10 microseconds) is also consistent\n","with the measured values of 0~50 microseconds. The previous observation of\n","substeps within the 8-nm step is explained. The shapes of velocity-load (both\n","positive and negative) curves show resemblance to previous experimental\n","results.\n","Myosin V and myosin VI are two classes of two-headed molecular motors of the\n","myosin superfamily that move processively along helical actin filaments in\n","opposite directions. Here we present a hand-over-hand model for their\n","processive movements. In the model, the moving direction of a dimeric molecular\n","motor is automatically determined by the relative orientation between its two\n","heads at free state and its head's binding orientation on track filament. This\n","determines that myosin V moves toward the barbed end and myosin VI moves toward\n","the pointed end of actin. During the moving period in one step, one head\n","remains bound to actin for myosin V whereas two heads are detached for myosin\n","VI: The moving manner is determined by the length of neck domain. This\n","naturally explains the similar dynamic behaviors but opposite moving directions\n","of myosin VI and mutant myosin V (the neck of which is truncated to only\n","one-sixth of the native length). Because of different moving manners, myosin VI\n","and mutant myosin V exhibit significantly broader step-size distribution than\n","native myosin V. However, all three motors give the same mean step size of 36\n","nm (the pseudo-repeat of actin helix). Using the model we study the dynamics of\n","myosin V quantitatively, with theoretical results in agreement with previous\n","experimental ones.\n","We describe a faster and more accurate algorithm for computing the\n","statistical mechanics of DNA denaturation according to the Poland-Scheraga\n","type. Nearest neighbor thermodynamics is included in a complete and general\n","way. The algorithm represents an optimization with respect to algorithmic\n","complexity of the partition function algorithm of Yeramian et al.: We reduce\n","the computation time for a base-pairing probability profile from O(N2) to O(N).\n","This speed-up comes in addition to the speed-up due to a multiexponential\n","approximation of the loop entropy factor as introduced by Fixman and Freire.\n","The speed-up, however, is independent of the multiexponential approximation and\n","reduces time from O(N3) to O(N2) in the exact case. In addition to calculating\n","the standard base-pairing probability profiles, we propose to use the algorithm\n","to calculate various other probabilities (loops, helices, tails) for a more\n","direct view of the melting regions and their positions and sizes.\n","A joint experimental / theoretical investigation of the elastin-like\n","octapeptide GVG(VPGVG) was carried out. In this paper a comprehensive molecular\n","dynamics study of the temperature dependent folding and unfolding of the\n","octapeptide is presented. The current study, as well as its experimental\n","counterpart find that this peptide undergoes an \"inverse temperature\n","transition\", ITT, leading to a folding at about 310-330 K. In addition, an\n","unfolding transition is identified at unusually high temperatures approaching\n","the boiling point of water. Due to the small size of the system two broad\n","temperature regimes are found: the \"ITT regime\" (at about 280-320 K) and the\n","\"unfolding regime\" at about T > 330 K, where the peptide has a maximum\n","probability of being folded at approximately 330 K. A detailed molecular\n","picture involving a thermodynamic order parameter, or reaction coordinate, for\n","this process is presented along with a time-correlation function analysis of\n","the hydrogen bond dynamics within the peptide as well as between the peptide\n","and solvating water molecules. Correlation with experimental evidence and\n","ramifications on the properties of elastin are discussed.\n","A simplified model for the closed circular DNA (ccDNA) is proposed to\n","describe some specific features of the helix-coil transition in such molecule.\n","The Hamiltonian of ccDNA is related to the one introduced earlier for the\n","linear DNA. The basic assumption is that the reduced energy of the hydrogen\n","bond is not constant through the transition process but depends effectively on\n","the fraction of already broken bonds. A transformation formula is obtained\n","which relates the temperature of ccDNA at a given degree of helicity during the\n","transition to the temperature of the corresponding linear chain at the same\n","degree of helicity. The formula provides a simple method to calculate the\n","melting curve for the ccDNA from the experimental melting curve of the linear\n","DNA with the same nucleotide sequence.\n","We develop a simple but rigorous model of protein-protein association\n","kinetics based on diffusional association on free energy landscapes obtained by\n","sampling configurations within and surrounding the native complex binding\n","funnels. Guided by results obtained on exactly solvable model problems, we\n","transform the problem of diffusion in a potential into free diffusion in the\n","presence of an absorbing zone spanning the entrance to the binding funnel. The\n","free diffusion problem is solved using a recently derived analytic expression\n","for the rate of association of asymmetrically oriented molecules. Despite the\n","required high steric specificity and the absence of long-range attractive\n","interactions, the computed rates are typically on the order of 10^4-10^6 M-1\n","s-1, several orders of magnitude higher than rates obtained using a purely\n","probabilistic model in which the association rate for free diffusion of\n","uniformly reactive molecules is multiplied by the probability of a correct\n","alignment of the two partners in a random collision. As the association rates\n","of many protein-protein complexes are also in the 10^5-10^6 M-1 s-1, our\n","results suggest that free energy barriers arising from desolvation and/or\n","side-chain freezing during complex formation or increased ruggedness within the\n","binding funnel, which are completely neglected in our simple diffusional model,\n","do not contribute significantly to the dynamics of protein-protein association.\n","The transparent physical interpretation of our approach that computes\n","association rates directly from the size and geometry of protein-protein\n","binding funnels makes it a useful complement to Brownian dynamics simulations.\n","Functional proteins must fold with some minimal stability to a structure that\n","can perform a biochemical task. Here we use a simple model to investigate the\n","relationship between the stability requirement and the capacity of a protein to\n","evolve the function of binding to a ligand. Although our model contains no\n","built-in tradeoff between stability and function, proteins evolved function\n","more efficiently when the stability requirement was relaxed. Proteins with both\n","high stability and high function evolved more efficiently when the stability\n","requirement was gradually increased than when there was constant selection for\n","high stability. These results show that in our model, the evolution of function\n","is enhanced by allowing proteins to explore sequences corresponding to\n","marginally stable structures, and that it is easier to improve stability while\n","maintaining high function than to improve function while maintaining high\n","stability. Our model also demonstrates that even in the absence of a\n","fundamental biophysical tradeoff between stability and function, the speed with\n","which function can evolve is limited by the stability requirement imposed on\n","the protein.\n","Using the model for the processive movement of a dimeric kinesin we proposed\n","before, we study the dynamics of a number of mutant homodimeric and\n","heterodimeric kinesins that were constructed by Kaseda et al. (Kaseda, K.,\n","Higuchi, H. and Hirose, K. PNAS 99, 16058 (2002)).

We also study the collective kinetic\n","behaviors of kinesins in MT-gliding motility. The results explains well that\n","the average MT-gliding velocity is independent of the number of bound motors\n","and is equal to the moving velocity of a single kinesin relative to MT.\n","The simplest approximation of interaction potential between amino-acids in\n","proteins is the contact potential, which defines the effective free energy of a\n","protein conformation by a set of amino acid contacts formed in this\n","conformation. Finding a contact potential capable of predicting free energies\n","of protein states across a variety of protein families will aid protein folding\n","and engineering in silico on a computationally tractable time-scale. We test\n","the ability of contact potentials to accurately and transferably (across\n","various protein families) predict stability changes of proteins upon mutations.\n","We develop a new methodology to determine the contact potentials in proteins\n","from experimental measurements of changes in protein thermodynamic stabilities\n","(ddG) upon mutations. We apply our methodology to derive sets of contact\n","interaction parameters for a hierarchy of interaction models including\n","solvation and multi-body contact parameters.

However, contact parameters can yield reliable predictions of ddG\n","for datasets of mutations confined to specific amino-acid positions in the\n","sequence of a single protein.\n","We first review how to determine the rate of vibrational energy relaxation\n","(VER) using perturbation theory. We then apply those theoretical results to the\n","problem of VER of a CD stretching mode in the protein cytochrome c. We model\n","cytochrome c in vacuum as a normal mode system with the lowest-order anharmonic\n","coupling elements. We find that, for the ``lifetime'' width parameter $\\gamma=3\n","\\sim 30$ cm$^{-1}$, the VER time is $0.2 \\sim 0.3$ ps, which agrees rather well\n","with the previous classical calculation using the quantum correction factor\n","method, and is consistent with spectroscopic experiments by Romesberg's group.\n","We decompose the VER rate into separate contributions from two modes, and find\n","that the most significant contribution, which depends on the ``lifetime'' width\n","parameter, comes from those modes most resonant with the CD vibrational mode.\n","The three-dimensional structures of two common repeat motifs\n","Val$^1$-Pro$^2$-Gly$^3$-Val$^4$-Gly$^5$ and\n","Val$^1$-Gly$^2$-Val$^3$-Pro$^4$-Gly$^5$-Val$^6$-Gly$^7$-Val$^8$-Pro$^9$ of\n","tropoelastin are investigated by using the multicanonical simulation procedure.\n","By minimizing the energy structures along the trajectory the thermodynamically\n","most stable low-energy microstates of the molecule are determined.

We study side chain effects using\n","square lattice and tetrahedral lattice models, with explicitly side chains of\n","two atoms. We distinguish effects due to chirality and effects due to side\n","chain flexibilities, since residues in proteins are L-residues, and their side\n","chains adopt different rotameric states. Short chains are enumerated\n","exhaustively. For long chains, we sample effectively rare events (eg, compact\n","conformations) and obtain complete pictures of ensemble properties of these\n","models at all compactness region. We find that both chirality and reduced side\n","chain flexibility lower the folding entropy significantly for globally compact\n","conformations, suggesting that they are important properties of residues to\n","ensure fast folding and stable native structure. This corresponds well with our\n","finding that natural amino acid residues have reduced effective flexibility, as\n","evidenced by analysis of rotamer libraries and side chain rotatable bonds. We\n","further develop a method calculating the exact side-chain entropy for a given\n","back bone structure. We show that simple rotamer counting often underestimates\n","side chain entropy significantly, and side chain entropy does not always\n","correlate well with main chain packing.

This representation is expected to provide a useful\n","tool in bioinformatics algorithms for protein structure comparison and\n","alignment, as well as a promising intermediate step towards protein structure\n","prediction.\n","Function of proteins or a network of interacting proteins often involves\n","communication between residues that are well separated in sequence. The classic\n","example is the participation of distant residues in allosteric regulation.\n","Bioinformatic and structural analysis methods have been introduced to infer\n","residues that are correlated. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to\n","obtain the sequence properties that determine the tendency of disease related\n","proteins (Abeta peptides, prion proteins, transthyretin etc.) to aggregate and\n","form fibrils. Motivated in part by the need to identify sequence\n","characteristics that indicate a tendency to aggregate, we introduce a general\n","method that probes covariations in charged residues along the sequence in a\n","given protein family. The method, which involves computing the Sequence\n","Correlation Entropy (SCE) using the quenched probability Psk(i,j) of finding a\n","residue pair at a given sequence separation sk, allows us to classify protein\n","families in terms of their SCE. Our general approach may be a useful way in\n","obtaining evolutionary covariations of amino acid residues on a genome wide\n","level.\n","We present an analysis of the effects of global topology on the structural\n","stability of folded proteins in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath. For a\n","large class of single domain proteins, we computed the harmonic spectrum within\n","the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) and determined the spectral dimension, a\n","parameter describing the low frequency behaviour of the density of modes. We\n","find a surprisingly strong correlation between the spectral dimension and the\n","number of amino acids of the protein. Considering that larger spectral\n","dimension value relate to more topologically compact folded state, our results\n","indicate that for a given temperature and length of the protein, the folded\n","structure corresponds to the less compact folding compatible with thermodynamic\n","stability.\n","We present a simple physical model which demonstrates that the native state\n","folds of proteins can emerge on the basis of considerations of geometry and\n","symmetry. We show that the inherent anisotropy of a chain molecule, the\n","geometrical and energetic constraints placed by the hydrogen bonds and sterics,\n","and hydrophobicity are sufficient to yield a free energy landscape with broad\n","minima even for a homopolymer. These minima correspond to marginally compact\n","structures comprising the menu of folds that proteins choose from to house\n","their native-states in. Our results provide a general framework for\n","understanding the common characteristics of globular proteins.\n","With the aim to study the relationship between protein sequences and their\n","native structures, we adopt vectorial representations for both sequence and\n","structure. The structural representation is based on the Principal Eigenvector\n","of the fold's contact matrix (PE). As recently shown, the latter encodes\n","sufficient information for reconstructing the whole contact matrix. The\n","sequence is represented through a Hydrophobicity Profile (HP), using a\n","generalized hydrophobicity scale that we obtain from the principal eigenvector\n","of a residue-residue interaction matrix and denote it as interactivity scale.\n","Using this novel scale, we define the optimal HP of a protein fold, and\n","predict, by means of stability arguments, that it is strongly correlated with\n","the PE of the fold's contact matrix. This prediction is confirmed through an\n","evolutionary analysis, which shows that the PE correlates with the HP of each\n","individual sequence adopting the same fold and, even more strongly, with the\n","average HP of this set of sequences. Thus, protein sequences evolve in such a\n","way that their average HP is close to the optimal one, implying that neutral\n","evolution can be viewed as a kind of motion in sequence space around the\n","optimal HP. Our results indicate that the correlation coefficient between\n","N-dimensional vectors constitutes a natural metric in the vectorial space in\n","which we represent both protein sequences and protein structures, which we call\n","Vectorial Protein Space. In this way, we define a unified framework for\n","sequence to sequence, sequence to structure, and structure to structure\n","alignments. We show that the interactivity scale is nearly optimal both for the\n","comparison of sequences with sequences and sequences with structures.\n","We fit the Fourier transforms of solvent accessibility and hydrophobicity\n","profiles of a representative set of proteins to a joint multi-variable\n","Gaussian. This allows us to separate the intrinsic tendencies of sequence and\n","structure profiles from the interactions that correlate them; for example, the\n","$\\alpha$-helix periodicity in sequence hydrophobicity is dictated by the\n","solvent accessibility of structures. The distinct intrinsic tendencies of\n","sequence and structure profiles are most pronounced at long periods, where\n","sequence hydrophobicity fluctuates more, while solvent accessibility\n","fluctuations are less than average. Interestingly, correlations between the two\n","profiles can be interpreted as the Boltzmann weight of the solvation energy at\n","room temperature.\n","In this paper, we examine the mechanical role of the lipid bilayer in ion\n","channel conformation and function with specific reference to the case of the\n","mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL). In a recent paper\n","(Wiggins and Phillips, 2004), we argued that mechanotransduction very naturally\n","arises from lipid-protein interactions by invoking a simple analytic model of\n","the MscL channel and the surrounding lipid bilayer. In this paper, we focus on\n","improving and expanding this analytic framework for studying lipid-protein\n","interactions with special attention to MscL. Our goal is to generate simple\n","scaling relations which can be used to provide qualitative understanding of the\n","role of membrane mechanics in protein function and to quantitatively interpret\n","experimental results. For the MscL channel, we find that the free energies\n","induced by lipid-protein interaction are of the same order as the free energy\n","differences between conductance states measured by Sukharev et al. (1999). We\n","therefore conclude that the mechanics of the bilayer plays an essential role in\n","determining the conformation and function of the channel. Finally, we compare\n","the predictions of our model to experimental results from the recent\n","investigations of the MscL channel by Perozo et al. (2002), Powl et al. (2003),\n","Yoshimura et al. (2004), and others and suggest a suite of new experiments.\n","The conjunction of insights from structural biology, solution biochemistry,\n","genetics and single molecule biophysics has provided a renewed impetus for the\n","construction of quantitative models of biological processes. One area that has\n","been a beneficiary of these experimental techniques is the study of viruses. In\n","this paper we describe how the insights obtained from such experiments can be\n","utilized to construct physical models of processes in the viral life cycle. We\n","focus on dsDNA bacteriophages and show that the bending elasticity of DNA and\n","its electrostatics in solution can be combined to determine the forces\n","experienced during packaging and ejection of the viral genome. Furthermore, we\n","quantitatively analyze the effect of fluid viscosity and capsid expansion on\n","the forces experienced during packaging. Finally, we present a model for DNA\n","ejection from bacteriophages based on the hypothesis that the energy stored in\n","the tightly packed genome within the capsid leads to its forceful ejection. The\n","predictions of our model can be tested through experiments in vitro where DNA\n","ejection is inhibited by the application of external osmotic pressure.\n","Amyloid fibers are aggregates of proteins. They are built out of a peptide\n","called $\\beta$--amyloid (A$\\beta$) containing between 41 and 43 residues,\n","produced by the action of an enzyme which cleaves a much larger protein known\n","as the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). X-ray diffraction experiments have\n","shown that these fibrils are rich in $\\beta$--structures, whereas the shape of\n","the peptide displays an $\\alpha$--helix structure within the APP in its\n","biologically active conformation. A realistic model of fibril formation is\n","developed based on the seventeen residues A$\\beta$12--28 amyloid peptide, which\n","has been shown to form fibrils structurally similar to those of the whole\n","A$\\beta$ peptide. With the help of physical arguments and in keeping with\n","experimental findings, the A$\\beta$12--28 monomer is assumed to be in four\n","possible states (i.e., native helix conformation, $\\beta$--hairpin, globular\n","low--energy state and unfolded state). Making use of these monomeric states,\n","oligomers (dimers, tertramers and octamers) were constructed. With the help of\n","short, detailed Molecular Dynamics (MD) calculations of the three monomers and\n","of a variety of oligomers, energies for these structures were obtained. Making\n","use of these results within the framework of a simple yet realistic model to\n","describe the entropic terms associated with the variety of amyloid\n","conformations, a phase diagram can be calculated of the whole many--body\n","system, leading to a thermodynamical picture in overall agreement with the\n","experimental findings. In particular, the existence of micellar metastable\n","states seem to be a key issue to determine the thermodynamical properties of\n","the system.\n","The possibility of deriving the contact potentials between amino acids from\n","their frequencies of occurence in proteins is discussed in evolutionary terms.\n","This approach allows the use of traditional thermodynamics to describe such\n","frequencies and, consequently, to develop a strategy to include in the\n","calculations correlations due to the spatial proximity of the amino acids and\n","to their overall tendency of being conserved in proteins. Making use of a\n","lattice model to describe protein chains and defining a \"true\" potential, we\n","test these strategies by selecting a database of folding model sequences,\n","deriving the contact potentials from such sequences and comparing them with the\n","\"true\" potential. Taking into account correlations allows for a markedly better\n","prediction of the interaction potentials.\n","While all the information required for the folding of a protein is contained\n","in its amino acid sequence, one has not yet learned how to extract this\n","information to predict the three--dimensional, biologically active, native\n","conformation of a protein whose sequence is known. Using insight obtained from\n","simple model simulations of the folding of proteins, in particular of the fact\n","that this phenomenon is essentially controlled by conserved (native) contacts\n","among (few) strongly interacting (\"hot\"), as a rule hydrophobic, amino acids,\n","which also stabilize local elementary structures (LES, hidden, incipient\n","secondary structures like $\\alpha$--helices and $\\beta$--sheets) formed early\n","in the folding process and leading to the postcritical folding nucleus (i.e.,\n","the minimum set of native contacts which bring the system pass beyond the\n","highest free--energy barrier found in the whole folding process) it is possible\n","to work out a succesful strategy for reading the native structure of designed\n","proteins from the knowledge of only their amino acid sequence and of the\n","contact energies among the amino acids. Because LES have undergone millions of\n","years of evolution to selectively dock to their complementary structures, small\n","peptides made out of the same amino acids as the LES are expected to\n","selectively attach to the newly expressed (unfolded) protein and inhibit its\n","folding, or to the native (fluctuating) native conformation and denaturate it.\n","These peptides, or their mimetic molecules, can thus be used as effective\n","non--conventional drugs to those already existing (and directed at neutralizing\n","the active site of enzymes), displaying the advantage of not suffering from the\n","uprise of resistance.\n","Methods for alignment of protein sequences typically measure similarity by\n","using substitution matrix with scores for all possible exchanges of one amino\n","acid with another. Although widely used, the matrices derived from homologous\n","sequence segments, such as Dayhoff's PAM matrices and Henikoff's BLOSUM\n","matrices, are not specific for protein conformation identification. Using a\n","different approach, we got many amino acid segment blocks. For each of them,\n","the protein secondary structure is identical. Based on these blocks, we have\n","derived new amino acid substitution matrices. The application of these matrices\n","led to marked improvements in conformation segment search and homologues\n","detection in twilight zone.\n","The advent of new experimental genomic technologies and the massive increase\n","of DNA sequence information is helping researchers better understand how our\n","genes work. Recently, experiments on mRNA abundance (gene expression) have\n","revealed that gene expression shows a stationary organization described by a\n","power-law distribution (scale-free organization) (i.e., gene expression $k$\n","decays as $k^{-\\gamma}$), which is highly conserved in all the major five\n","kingdoms of life, from Bacteria to Human. An underlying gene expression\n","dynamics \"rich-travel-more\" was suggested to recover that evolutional\n","conservation of transcriptional organization. Here we propose a constructive\n","approach to gene expression dynamics with larger scope. Our gene expression\n","construction restores the stationary state, predicts the power-law exponent for\n","different organisms with natural explanation for small correction at high and\n","low expression levels, describes the intermediate state dynamics (time finite)\n","and elucidates the gene expression stability. This approach requires only one\n","assumption: Markov property.\n","Proteins are minimally frustrated polymers. However, for realistic protein\n","models non-native interactions must be taken into account. In this paper we\n","analyze the effect of non-native interactions on the folding rate and on the\n","folding free energy barrier. We present an analytic theory to account for the\n","modification on the free energy landscape upon introduction of non-native\n","contacts, added as a perturbation to the strong native interactions driving\n","folding. Our theory predicts a rate-enhancement regime at fixed temperature,\n","under the introduction of weak, non-native interactions. We have thoroughly\n","tested this theoretical prediction with simulations of a coarse-grained protein\n","model, by employing an off-lattice $C_\\alpha$ model of the src-SH3 domain. The\n","strong agreement between results from simulations and theory confirm the non\n","trivial result that a relatively small amount of non-native interaction energy\n","can actually assist the folding to the native structure.\n","An effective potential function is critical for protein structure prediction\n","and folding simulation. For simplified models of proteins where coordinates of\n","only $C_\\alpha$ atoms need to be specified, an accurate potential function is\n","important. Such a simplified model is essential for efficient search of\n","conformational space. In this work, we present a formulation of potential\n","function for simplified representations of protein structures. It is based on\n","the combination of descriptors derived from residue-residue contact and\n","sequence-dependent local geometry. The optimal weight coefficients for contact\n","and local geometry is obtained through optimization by maximizing margins among\n","native and decoy structures. The latter are generated by chain growth and by\n","gapless threading. The performance of the potential function in blind test of\n","discriminating native protein structures from decoys is evaluated using several\n","benchmark decoy sets. This potential function have comparable or better\n","performance than several residue-based potential functions that require in\n","addition coordinates of side chain centers or coordinates of all side chain\n","atoms.\n","Circular permutation connects the N and C termini of a protein and\n","concurrently cleaves elsewhere in the chain, providing an important mechanism\n","for generating novel protein fold and functions. However, their in genomes is\n","unknown because current detection methods can miss many occurances, mistaking\n","random repeats as circular permutation. Here we develop a method for detecting\n","circularly permuted proteins from structural comparison. Sequence order\n","independent alignment of protein structures can be regarded as a special case\n","of the maximum-weight independent set problem, which is known to be\n","computationally hard. We develop an efficient approximation algorithm by\n","repeatedly solving relaxations of an appropriate intermediate integer\n","programming formulation, we show that the approximation ratio is much better\n","then the theoretical worst case ratio of $r = 1/4$. Circularly permuted\n","proteins reported in literature can be identified rapidly with our method,\n","while they escape the detection by publicly available servers for structural\n","alignment.\n","Motivation. Protein design aims to identify sequences compatible with a given\n","protein fold but incompatible to any alternative folds. To select the correct\n","sequences and to guide the search process, a design scoring function is\n","critically important. Such a scoring function should be able to characterize\n","the global fitness landscape of many proteins simultaneously.\n","  Results. To find optimal design scoring functions, we introduce two geometric\n","views and propose a formulation using mixture of nonlinear Gaussian kernel\n","functions. We aim to solve a simplified protein sequence design problem. Our\n","goal is to distinguish each native sequence for a major portion of\n","representative protein structures from a large number of alternative decoy\n","sequences, each a fragment from proteins of different fold. Our scoring\n","function discriminate perfectly a set of 440 native proteins from 14 million\n","sequence decoys. We show that no linear scoring function can succeed in this\n","task. In a blind test of unrelated proteins, our scoring function misclassfies\n","only 13 native proteins out of 194. This compares favorably with about 3-4\n","times more misclassifications when optimal linear functions reported in\n","literature are used. We also discuss how to develop protein folding scoring\n","function.\n","Being HIV-1-PR an essential enzyme in the viral life cycle, its inhibition\n","can control AIDS. Because the folding of single domain proteins, like HIV-1-PR\n","is controlled by local elementary structures (LES, folding units stabilized by\n","strongly interacting, highly conserved amino acids) which have evolved over\n","myriads of generations to recognize and strongly attract each other so as to\n","make the protein fold fast, we suggest a novel type of HIV-1-PR inhibitors\n","which interfere with the folding of the protein: short peptides displaying the\n","same amino acid sequence of that of LES. Theoretical and experimental evidence\n","for the specificity and efficiency of such inhibitors are presented.\n","Vibrational energy relaxation (VER) of a selected mode in cytochrome c\n","(hemeprotein) in vacuum is studied using two theoretical approaches: One is the\n","equilibrium simulation approach with quantum correction factors, and the other\n","is the reduced model approach which describes the protein as an ensemble of\n","normal modes coupled with nonlinear coupling elements. Both methods result in\n","estimates of VER time (sub ps) for a CD stretching mode in the protein at room\n","temperature, that are in accord with the experimental data of Romesberg's\n","group. The applicability of the two methods is examined through a discussion of\n","the validity of Fermi's golden rule on which the two methods are based.\n","The 16-22 amino acid fragment of the beta-amyloid peptide associated with the\n","Alzheimer's disease, Abeta, is capable of forming amyloid fibrils. Here we\n","study the aggregation mechanism of Abeta(16-22) peptides by unbiased\n","thermodynamic simulations at the atomic level for systems of one, three and six\n","Abeta(16-22) peptides. We find that the isolated Abeta(16-22) peptide is mainly\n","a random coil in the sense that both the alpha-helix and beta-strand contents\n","are low, whereas the three- and six-chain systems form aggregated structures\n","with a high beta-sheet content. Furthermore, in agreement with experiments on\n","Abeta(16-22) fibrils, we find that large parallel beta-sheets are unlikely to\n","form. For the six-chain system, the aggregated structures can have many\n","different shapes, but certain particularly stable shapes can be identified.\n","We identified latent periodicity in catalytic domains of approximately 85% of\n","serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases. Similar results were obtained\n","for other 22 protein domains. We also designed the method of noise\n","decomposition, which is aimed to distinguish between different periodicity\n","types of the same period length.

A method for\n","disassembling and reconstructing the conformation and dynamics of the\n","nucleosome using Fourier analysis is presented. Results indicate that the\n","superhelical path of DNA in the nucleosome is irregular.

These variations are required to create a\n","proposed tetrasome conformation or to qualitatively reconstruct the 1.75 turns\n","of the nuclesomal superhelix.

Reconstruction of free\n","DNA using selected long wavelength variations in conformation can produce\n","either a left-handed or a right-handed superhelix.

The binding of RNA fragments involving other\n","sequences than the intended target is problematic because it adds a \"chemical\n","background\" to the signal, which is not related to the expression degree of the\n","target gene. The paper presents a molecular signature of specific and non\n","specific hybridization with potential consequences for gene expression\n","analysis. We analyzed the signal intensities of perfect match (PM) and mismatch\n","(MM) probes of GeneChip microarrays to specify the effect of specific and non\n","specific hybridization. We found that these events give rise to different\n","relations between the PM and MM intensities as function of the middle base of\n","the PMs, namely a triplet- (C>G=T>A>0) and a duplet-like (C=T>0>G=A) pattern of\n","the PM-MM log-intensity difference upon binding of specific and non specific\n","RNA fragments, respectively. The systematic behaviour of the intensity\n","difference can be rationalized on the level of base pairings of DNA/RNA\n","oligonucleotide duplexes in the middle of the probe sequence. Non-specific\n","binding is characterized by the reversal of the central Watson Crick (WC)\n","pairing for each PM/MM probe pair, whereas specific binding refers to the\n","combination of a WC and a self complementary (SC) pairing in PM and MM probes,\n","respectively. The intensity of complementary MM introduces a systematic source\n","of variation which decreases the precision of expression measures based on the\n","MM intensities.\n","We implement the replica exchange molecular dynamics algorithm to study the\n","interactions of a model peptide (WALP-16) with an explicitly represented DPPC\n","membrane bilayer. We observe the spontaneous, unbiased insertion of WALP-16\n","into the DPPC bilayer and its folding into an a-helix with a trans-bilayer\n","orientation. We observe that the insertion of the peptide into the DPPC bilayer\n","precedes secondary structure formation. Although the peptide has some\n","propensity to form a partially helical structure in the interfacial region of\n","the DPPC/water system, this state is not a productive intermediate but rather\n","an off-pathway trap for WALP-16 insertion. Equilibrium simulations show that\n","the observed insertion/folding pathway mirrors the potential of mean force\n","(PMF). Calculation of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to this PMF show\n","that the surface bound conformation of WALP-16 is significantly lower in energy\n","than other conformations, and that the insertion of WALP-16 into the bilayer\n","without regular secondary structure is enthalpically unfavorable by 5-10\n","kcal/mol/residue. The observed insertion/folding pathway disagrees with the\n","dominant conceptual model, which is that a surface bound helix is an obligatory\n","intermediate for the insertion of a-helical peptides into lipid bilayers. In\n","our simulations, the observed insertion/folding pathway is favored because of a\n","large (> 100 kcal/mol) increase in system entropy that occurs when the\n","unstructured WALP-16 peptide enters the lipid bilayer interior. The\n","insertion/folding pathway that is lowest in free energy depends sensitively on\n","the near cancellation of large enthalpic and entropic terms. This suggests that\n","intrinsic membrane peptides may have a diversity of insertion/folding behaviors\n","depending on the exact system of peptide and lipid under consideration.\n","Analysis of data from an Affymetrix Latin Square spike-in experiment\n","indicates that measured fluorescence intensities of features on an\n","oligonucleotide microarray are related to spike-in RNA target concentrations\n","via a hyperbolic response function, generally identified as a Langmuir\n","adsorption isotherm. Furthermore the asymptotic signal at high spike-in\n","concentrations is almost invariably lower for a mismatch feature than for its\n","partner perfect match feature. We survey a number of theoretical adsorption\n","models of hybridization at the microarray surface and find that in general they\n","are unable to explain the differing saturation responses of perfect and\n","mismatch features. On the other hand, we find that a simple and consistent\n","explanation can be found in a model in which equilibrium hybridization followed\n","by partial dissociation of duplexes during the post-hybridization washing\n","phase.\n","A model for the processive movement of dynein is presented based on\n","experimental observations available. In the model, the change from strong\n","microtubule-binding to weak binding of dynein is determined naturally by the\n","variation of the relative orientation between the two interacting surfaces of\n","the stalk tip and the microtubule as the stalk rotates from the ADP.Vi-state\n","orientation to the apo-state orientation. This means that the puzzling\n","communication from the ATP binding site in the globular head to the MT-binding\n","site in the tip of the stalk, which is prerequisite in the conventional model,\n","is not required. Using the present model, the previous experimental results,\n","such as (i) the step size of a dynein being an integer times of the period of\n","the MT lattice, (ii) the dependence of the step size on load, i.e., the step\n","size decreasing with the increase of load, and (iii) the stall force being\n","proportional to [ATP] at low [ATP] and becoming saturated at high [ATP], are\n","well explained.\n","We address the controversial hot question concerning the validity of the\n","loose coupling versus the lever-arm theories in the actomyosin dynamics by\n","re-interpreting and extending the phenomenological washboard potential model\n","proposed by some of us in a previous paper. In this new model a Brownian motion\n","harnessing thermal energy is assumed to co-exist with the deterministic swing\n","of the lever-arm, to yield an excellent fit of the set of data obtained by some\n","of us on the sliding of Myosin II heads on immobilized actin filaments under\n","various load conditions. Our theoretical arguments are complemented by accurate\n","numerical simulations, and the robustness of the model is tested via different\n","choices of parameters and potential profiles.\n","In this paper we investigate the role of native geometry on the kinetics of\n","protein folding based on simple lattice models and Monte Carlo simulations.\n","Results obtained within the scope of the Miyazawa-Jernigan indicate the\n","existence of two dynamical folding regimes depending on the protein chain\n","length. For chains larger than 80 amino acids the folding performance is\n","sensitive to the native state's conformation. Smaller chains, with less than 80\n","amino acids, fold via two-state kinetics and exhibit a significant correlation\n","between the contact order parameter and the logarithmic folding times. In\n","particular, chains with N=48 amino acids were found to belong to two broad\n","classes of folding, characterized by different cooperativity, depending on the\n","contact order parameter. Preliminary results based on the G\\={o} model show\n","that the effect of long range contact interaction strength in the folding\n","kinetics is largely dependent on the native state's geometry.\n","Monte Carlo simulations show that long-range interactions play a major role\n","in determining the folding rates of 48-mer three-dimensional lattice polymers\n","modelled by the Go potential. For three target structures with different native\n","geometries we found a sharp increase in the folding time when the relative\n","contribution of the long-range interactions to the native state's energy is\n","decreased from ~50% towards zero. However, the dispersion of the simulated\n","folding times depends strongly on the native geometry and Go polymers folding\n","to one of the target structures exhibit folding times spanning three orders of\n","magnitude. We have also found that, depending on the target geometry, a strong\n","geometric coupling may exist between local and long-range contacts meaning\n","that, when this coupling exists, the formation of long-range contacts is forced\n","by the previous formation of local contacts. The absence of a strong geometric\n","coupling leads to kinetics that are more sensitive to the interaction energy\n","parameters; in this case the formation of local contacts is not sufficient to\n","promote the establishment of long-range ones when these are strongly penalized\n","energetically, leading to longer folding times.\n","A simplified interaction potential for protein folding studies at the atomic\n","level is discussed and tested on a set of peptides with about 20 residues each.\n","The test set contains both alpha-helical (Trp cage, Fs) and beta-sheet (GB1p,\n","GB1m2, GB1m3, Betanova, LLM) peptides.

Furthermore, the melting behavior of the peptides\n","is in good quantitative agreement with experimental data. Apparent folded\n","populations obtained using different observables are compared, and are found to\n","be very different for some of the peptides (e.g., Betanova). In other cases (in\n","particular, GB1m2 and GB1m3), the different estimates agree reasonably well,\n","indicating a more two-state-like melting behavior.\n","Single molecule FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) is a powerful\n","technique for detecting real-time conformational changes and molecular\n","interactions during biological reactions.

For the complexes of\n","DNA with counterions Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+ the normal modes have been\n","found, and a mode characterized by the most notable ion displacements with\n","respect to the DNA backbone has been determined. The frequency of counterion\n","vibrations has been established to decrease as the ion mass increases.

The\n","theoretical predictions are in accord with the experimental data of Romesberg's\n","group. A perspective on future directions for the detailed study of time scales\n","and mechanisms for VER in proteins is presented.\n","Protein one-dimensional (1D) structures such as secondary structure and\n","contact number provide intuitive pictures to understand how the native\n","three-dimensional (3D) structure of a protein is encoded in the amino acid\n","sequence. However, it has not been clear whether a given set of 1D structures\n","contains sufficient information for recovering the underlying 3D structure.\n","Here we show that the 3D structure of a protein can be recovered from a set of\n","three types of 1D structures, namely, secondary structure, contact number and\n","residue-wise contact order which is introduced here for the first time. Using\n","simulated annealing molecular dynamics simulations, the structures satisfying\n","the given native 1D structural restraints were sought for 16 proteins of\n","various structural classes and of sizes ranging from 56 to 146 residues. By\n","selecting the structures best satisfying the restraints, all the proteins\n","showed a coordinate RMS deviation of less than 4\\AA{} from the native\n","structure, and for most of them, the deviation was even less than 2\\AA{}. The\n","present result opens a new possibility to protein structure prediction and our\n","understanding of the sequence-structure relationship.\n","The lack of specificity in microarray experiments due to non-specific\n","hybridization raises a serious problem for the analysis of microarray data\n","because the residual chemical background intensity is not related to the\n","expression degree of the gene of interest. We analyzed the concentration\n","dependence of the signal intensity of perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM)\n","probes in terms using a microscopic binding model using a combination of mean\n","hybridization isotherms and single base related affinity terms. The signal\n","intensities of the PM and MM probes and their difference are assessed with\n","regard to their sensitivity, specificity and resolution for gene expression\n","measures. The presented theory implies the refinement of existing algorithms of\n","probe level analysis to correct microarray data for non-specific background\n","intensities.\n","Residue-wise contact order (RWCO) is a new kind of one-dimensional protein\n","structures which represents the extent of long-range contacts. We have recently\n","shown that a set of three types of one-dimensional structures (secondary\n","structure, contact number, and RWCO) contains sufficient information for\n","reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of proteins. Currently, there\n","exist prediction methods for secondary structure and contact number from amino\n","acid sequence, but none exists for RWCO. Also, the properties of amino acids\n","that affect RWCO is not clearly understood. Here, we present a linear\n","regression-based method to predict RWCO from amino acid sequence, and analyze\n","the regression parameters to identify the properties that correlates with the\n","RWCO. The present method achieves the significant correlation of 0.59 between\n","the native and predicted RWCOs on average. An unusual feature of the RWCO\n","prediction is the remarkably large optimal half window size of 26 residues. The\n","regression parameters for the central and near-central residues of the local\n","sequence segment highly correlate with those of the contact number prediction,\n","and hence with hydrophobicity.\n","In this paper the heat signaling in microtubules (MT) is investigated. It is\n","argued that for the description of the heat signaling phenomena in MT, the\n","hyperbolic heat transport (HHT) equation must be used. It is shown that HHT is\n","the Klein-Gordon (K-G) equation. The general solution for the K-G equation for\n","MT is obtained.

In this process, the correlation\n","among genes is crucial to determine the specific functions of genes. Here, we\n","propose a novel multi-dimensional stochastic approach to deal with the gene\n","correlation phenomena. Interestingly, our stochastic framework suggests that\n","the study of the gene correlation requires only one theoretical assumption\n","-Markov property- and the experimental transition probability, which\n","characterizes the gene correlation system. Finally, a gene expression\n","experiment is proposed for future applications of the model.\n","The importance of understanding the mechanism of protein aggregation into\n","insoluble amyloid fibrils relies not only on its medical consequences, but also\n","on its more basic properties of self--organization. The discovery that a large\n","number of uncorrelated proteins can form, under proper conditions, structurally\n","similar fibrils has suggested that the underlying mechanism is a general\n","feature of polypeptide chains. In the present work, we address the early events\n","preceeding amyloid fibril formation in solutions of zinc--free human insulin\n","incubated at low pH and high temperature. Aside from being a easy--to--handle\n","model for protein fibrillation, subcutaneous aggregation of insulin after\n","injection is a nuisance which affects patients with diabetes. Here, we show by\n","time--lapse atomic force microscopy (AFM) that a steady-state distribution of\n","protein oligomers with an exponential tail is reached within few minutes after\n","heating. This metastable phase lasts for few hours until aggregation into\n","fibrils suddenly occurs. A theoretical explanation of the oligomer\n","pre--fibrillar distribution is given in terms of a simple\n","coagulation--evaporation kinetic model, in which concentration plays the role\n","of a critical parameter. Due to high resolution and sensitivity of AFM\n","technique, the observation of a long-lasting latency time should be considered\n","an actual feature of the aggregation process, and not simply ascribed to\n","instrumental inefficency. These experimental facts, along with the kinetic\n","model used, claim for a critical role of thermal concentration fluctuations in\n","the process of fibril nucleation.\n","Identical objects, regularly assembled, form a helix, which is the principal\n","motif of nucleic acids, proteins, and viral capsids.\n","The ambitious and ultimate research purpose in Systems Biology is the\n","understanding and modelling of the cell's system. Although a vast number of\n","models have been developed in order to extract biological knowledge from\n","complex systems composed of basic elements as proteins, genes and chemical\n","compounds, a need remains for improving our understanding of dynamical features\n","of the systems (i.e., temporal-dependence).\n","  In this article, we analyze the gene expression dynamics (i.e., how the genes\n","expression fluctuates in time) by using a new constructive approach. This\n","approach is based on only two fundamental ingredients: symmetry and the Markov\n","property of dynamics. First, by using experimental data of human and yeast gene\n","expression time series, we found a symmetry in short-time transition\n","probability from time $t$ to time $t+1$. We call it self-similarity symmetry\n","(i.e., surprisingly, the gene expression short-time fluctuations contain a\n","repeating pattern of smaller and smaller parts that are like the whole, but\n","different in size). Secondly, the Markov property of dynamics reflects that the\n","short-time fluctuation governs the full-time behaviour of the system. Here, we\n","succeed in reconstructing naturally the global behavior of the observed\n","distribution of gene expression (i.e., scaling-law) and the local behaviour of\n","the power-law tail of this distribution, by using only these two ingredients:\n","symmetry and the Markov property of dynamics. This approach may represent a\n","step forward toward an integrated image of the basic elements of the whole\n","cell.\n","In this work, the dynamics of fluctuations in gene expression time series is\n","investigated. By using collected data of gene expression from yeast and human\n","organisms, we found that the fluctuations of gene expression level and its\n","average value over time are strongly correlated and obey a scaling law. As this\n","feature is found in yeast and human organisms, it suggests that probably this\n","coupling is a common dynamical organizing property of all living systems. To\n","understand these observations, we propose a stochastic model which can explain\n","these collective fluctuations, and predict the scaling exponent. Interestingly,\n","our results indicate that the observed scaling law emerges from the\n","self-similarity symmetry embedded in gene expression fluctuations.\n","We study the mechanism underlying the attraction between nucleosomes, the\n","fundamental packaging units of DNA inside the chromatin complex. We introduce a\n","simple model of the nucleosome, the eight-tail colloid, consisting of a charged\n","sphere with eight oppositely charged, flexible, grafted chains that represent\n","the terminal histone tails. We demonstrate that our complexes are attracted via\n","the formation of chain bridges and that this attraction can be tuned by\n","changing the fraction of charged monomers on the tails. This suggests a\n","physical mechanism of chromatin compaction where the degree of DNA condensation\n","can be controlled via biochemical means, namely the acetylation and\n","deacetylation of lysines in the histone tails.\n","The effects of monovalent (Na+, K+) and divalent (Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+) ions on\n","the interaction between DNA and histone are studied using the molecular combing\n","technique. Lamda-DNA molecules and DNA-histone complexes incubated with metal\n","cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+) are stretched on hydrophobic surfaces, and\n","directly observed by fluorescence microscopy. The results indicate that when\n","these cations are added into the DNA solution, the fluorescence intensities of\n","the stained DNA are reduced differently. The monovalent cations (Na+, K+)\n","inhibit binding of histone to DNA. The divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+)\n","enhance significantly the binding of histone to DNA and the binding of the\n","DNA-histone complex to the hydrophobic surface. Mn2+ also induces condensation\n","and aggregation of the DNA-histone complex.\n","PDZ (Post-synaptic density-95/discs large/zonula occludens-1) domains are\n","relatively small (80 to 120 residues) protein binding modules central in the\n","organization of receptor clusters and in the association of cellular proteins.\n","Their main function is to bind C-terminals of selected proteins that are\n","recognized through specific amino-acids in their carboxyl end. Binding is\n","associated with a deformation of the PDZ native structure and is responsible\n","for dynamical changes in regions not in direct contact with the target. We\n","investigate how this deformation is related to the harmonic dynamics of the PDZ\n","structure and show that one low-frequency collective normal mode, characterized\n","by the concerted movements of different secondary structures, is involved in\n","the binding process. Our results suggest that even minimal structural changes\n","are responsible of communication between distant regions of the protein, in\n","agreement with recent Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments. Thus PDZ\n","domains are a very clear example of how collective normal modes are able to\n","characterize the relation between function and dynamics of proteins, and to\n","provide indications on the precursors of binding/unbonding events.\n","We introduce a new measure of antigenic distance between influenza A vaccine\n","and circulating strains. The measure correlates well with efficacies of the\n","H3N2 influenza A component of the annual vaccine between 1971 and 2004, as do\n","results of a theory of the immune response to influenza following vaccination.\n","This new measure of antigenic distance is correlated with vaccine efficacy to a\n","greater degree than are current state-of-the-art phylogenetic sequence analyzes\n","or ferret antisera inhibition assays. We suggest that this new measure of\n","antigenic distance be used in the design of the annual influenza vaccine and in\n","the interpretation of vaccine efficacy monitoring.\n","Prediction of one-dimensional protein structures such as secondary structures\n","and contact numbers is useful for the three-dimensional structure prediction\n","and important for the understanding of sequence-structure relationship. Here we\n","present a new machine-learning method, critical random networks (CRNs), for\n","predicting one-dimensional structures, and apply it, with position-specific\n","scoring matrices, to the prediction of secondary structures (SS), contact\n","numbers (CN), and residue-wise contact orders (RWCO). The present method\n","achieves, on average, $Q_3$ accuracy of 77.8% for SS, correlation coefficients\n","of 0.726 and 0.601 for CN and RWCO, respectively. The accuracy of the SS\n","prediction is comparable to other state-of-the-art methods, and that of the CN\n","prediction is a significant improvement over previous methods. We give a\n","detailed formulation of critical random networks-based prediction scheme, and\n","examine the context-dependence of prediction accuracies. In order to study the\n","nonlinear and multi-body effects, we compare the CRNs-based method with a\n","purely linear method based on position-specific scoring matrices. Although not\n","superior to the CRNs-based method, the surprisingly good accuracy achieved by\n","the linear method highlights the difficulty in extracting structural features\n","of higher order from amino acid sequence beyond that provided by the\n","position-specific scoring matrices.\n","We describe the results obtained from an improved model for protein folding.\n","We find that a good agreement with the native structure of a 46 residue long,\n","five-letter protein segment is obtained by carefully tuning the parameters of\n","the self-avoiding energy. In particular we find an improved free-energy\n","profile. We also compare the efficiency of the multidimensional replica\n","exchange method with the widely used parallel tempering.\n","We use single-particle tracking to study the elastic properties of single\n","microtubules grafted to a substrate. Thermal fluctuations of the free\n","microtubule's end are recorded, in order to measure position distribution\n","functions from which we calculate the persistence length of microtubules with\n","contour lengths between 2.6 and 48 micrometers. We find the persistence length\n","to vary by more than a factor of 20 over the total range of contour lengths.\n","Our results support the hypothesis that shearing between protofilaments\n","contributes significantly to the mechanics of microtubules.\n","Optimal structure of proteins is described by linear stochastic differential\n","equation with mean decrease of free energy and volatility. Structure\n","determining strategy is given by a twin of stochastic variables for which\n","empirical conditions are not postulated. Optimal structure determination will\n","be deformed to be adoptive to trading strategy employing martingale property\n","where stochastic integral w.r.t. analytical solution of stochastic differential\n","equation will be employed.\n","One of the main problems of drug design is that of optimizing the\n","drug--target interaction. In the case in which the target is a viral protein\n","displaying a high mutation rate, a second problem arises, namely the eventual\n","development of resistance. We wish to suggest a scheme for the design of\n","non--conventional drugs which do not face any of these problems and apply it to\n","the case of HIV--1 protease. It is based on the knowledge that the folding of\n","single--domain proteins, like e.g. each of the monomers forming the HIV--1--PR\n","homodimer, is controlled by local elementary structures (LES), stabilized by\n","local contacts among hydrophobic, strongly interacting and highly conserved\n","amino acids which play a central role in the folding process. Because LES have\n","evolved over myriads of generations to recognize and strongly interact with\n","each other so as to make the protein fold fast as well as to avoid aggregation\n","with other proteins, highly specific (and thus little toxic) as well as\n","effective folding--inhibitor drugs suggest themselves: short peptides (or\n","eventually their mimetic molecules), displaying the same amino acid sequence of\n","that of LES (p--LES). Aside from being specific and efficient, these inhibitors\n","are expected not to induce resistance: in fact, mutations which successfully\n","avoid their action imply the destabilization of one or more LES and thus should\n","lead to protein denaturation. Making use of Monte Carlo simulations within the\n","framework of a simple although not oversimplified model, which is able to\n","reproduce the main thermodynamic as well as dynamic properties of monoglobular\n","proteins, we first identify the LES of the HIV--1--PR and then show that the\n","corresponding p--LES peptides act as effective inhibitors of the folding of the\n","protease which do not create resistance.\n","Protein structure is generally conceptualized as the global arrangement or of\n","smaller, local motifs of helices, sheets, and loops. These regular, recurring\n","secondary structural elements have well-understood and standardized definitions\n","in terms of amino acid backbone geometry and the manner in which hydrogen\n","bonding requirements are satisfied. Recently, \"tube\" models have been proposed\n","to explain protein secondary structure in terms of the geometrically optimal\n","packing of a featureless cylinder. However, atomically detailed simulations\n","demonstrate that such packing considerations alone are insufficient for\n","defining secondary structure; both excluded volume and hydrogen bonding must be\n","explicitly modeled for helix formation. These results have fundamental\n","implications for the construction and interpretation of realistic and\n","meaningful biomacromolecular models.\n","Structure predictions of helical membrane proteins have been designed to take\n","advantage of the structural autonomy of secondary structure elements, as\n","postulated by the two-stage model of Engelman and Popot. In this context, we\n","investigate structure calculation strategies for two membrane proteins with\n","different functions, sizes, aminoacid compositions, and topologies: the\n","glycophorin A homodimer (a paradigm for close inter-helical packing in membrane\n","proteins) and aquaporin (a channel protein). Our structure calculations are\n","based on two alternative folding schemes: a one-step simulated annealing from\n","an extended chain conformation, and a two-step procedure inspired by the\n","grid-search methods traditionally used in membrane protein predictions. In this\n","framework, we investigate rationales for the utilization of sparse NMR data\n","such as distance-based restraints and residual dipolar couplings in structure\n","calculations of helical membrane proteins.\n","Proteins created by combinatorial methods in vitro are an important source of\n","information for understanding sequence-structure-function relationships.\n","Alignments of folded proteins from combinatorial libraries can be analyzed\n","using methods developed for naturally occurring proteins, but this neglects the\n","information contained in the unfolded sequences of the library. We introduce\n","two algorithms, logistic regression and excess information analysis, that use\n","both the folded and unfolded sequences and compare them against contingency\n","table and statistical coupling analysis, which only use the former. The test\n","set for this benchmark study is a library of fictitious proteins that fold\n","according to a hypothetical energy model. Of the four methods studied, only\n","logistic regression is able to correctly recapitulate the energy model from the\n","sequence alignment. The other algorithms predict spurious interactions between\n","alignment positions with strong but individual influences on protein stability.\n","When present in the same protein, stabilizing amino acids tend to lower the\n","energy below the threshold needed for folding. As a result, their frequencies\n","in the alignment can be correlated even if the positions do not interact. We\n","believe any algorithm that neglects the nonlinear relationship between folding\n","and energy is susceptible to this error.\n","In order to extend the results obtained with minimal lattice models to more\n","realistic systems, we study a model where proteins are described as a chain of\n","20 kinds of structureless amino acids moving in a continuum space and\n","interacting through a contact potential controlled by a 20x20 quenched random\n","matrix. The goal of the present work is to design and characterize amino acid\n","sequences folding to the SH3 conformation, a 60-residues recognition domain\n","common to many regulatory proteins. We show that a number of sequences can\n","fold, starting from a random conformation, to within a distance root mean\n","square deviation (dRMSD) of 2.6A from the native state. Good folders are those\n","sequences displaying in the native conformation an energy lower than a\n","sequence--independent threshold energy.\n","We recently introduced a physical model [Hoang et al., P. Natl. Acad. Sci.\n","USA (2004), Banavar et al., Phys. Rev. E (2004)] for proteins which\n","incorporates, in an approximate manner, several key features such as the\n","inherent anisotropy of a chain molecule, the geometrical and energetic\n","constraints placed by the hydrogen bonds and sterics, and the role played by\n","hydrophobicity. Within this framework, marginally compact conformations\n","resembling the native state folds of proteins emerge as broad competing minima\n","in the free energy landscape even for a homopolymer. Here we show how the\n","introduction of sequence heterogeneity using a simple scheme of just two types\n","of amino acids, hydrophobic (H) and polar (P), and sequence design allows a\n","selected putative native fold to become the free energy minimum at low\n","temperature. The folding transition exhibits thermodynamic cooperativity, if\n","one neglects the degeneracy between two different low energy conformations\n","sharing the same fold topology.\n","In eukaryote nucleosome, DNA wraps around a histone octamer in a left-handed\n","way. We study the process of chirality formation of nucleosome with Brownian\n","dynamics simulation. We model the histone octamer with a quantitatively\n","adjustable chirality: left-handed, right-handed or non-chiral, and simulate the\n","dynamical wrapping process of a DNA molecule on it. We find that the chirality\n","of a nucleosome formed is strongly dependent on that of the histone octamer,\n","and different chiralities of the histone octamer induce its different rotation\n","directions in the wrapping process of DNA. In addition, a very weak chirality\n","of the histone octamer is quite enough for sustaining the correct chirality of\n","the nucleosome formed. We also show that the chirality of a nucleosome may be\n","broken at elevated temperature.\n","Trypsin and chymotrypsin are both serine proteases with high sequence and\n","structural similarities, but with different substrate specificity. Previous\n","experiments have demonstrated the critical role of the two loops outside the\n","binding pocket in controlling the specificity of the two enzymes. To understand\n","the mechanism of such a control of specificity by distant loops, we have used\n","the Gaussian Network Model to study the dynamic properties of trypsin and\n","chymotrypsin and the roles played by the two loops. A clustering method was\n","introduced to analyze the correlated motions of residues. We have found that\n","trypsin and chymotrypsin have distinct dynamic signatures in the two loop\n","regions which are in turn highly correlated with motions of certain residues in\n","the binding pockets. Interestingly, replacing the two loops of trypsin with\n","those of chymotrypsin changes the motion style of trypsin to chymotrypsin-like,\n","whereas the same experimental replacement was shown necessary to make trypsin\n","have chymotrypsin's enzyme specificity and activity. These results suggest that\n","the cooperative motions of the two loops and the substrate-binding sites\n","contribute to the activity and substrate specificity of trypsin and\n","chymotrypsin.\n","The emergence and spreading of chirality on the early Earth is considered by\n","studying a set of reaction-diffusion equations based on a polymerization model.\n","It is found that effective mixing of the early oceans is necessary to reach the\n","present homochiral state. The possibility of introducing mass extinctions and\n","modifying the emergence rate of life is discussed.\n","Three situations in which filtering theory is used in mathematical finance\n","are illustrated at different levels of detail. The three problems originate\n","from the following different works: 1) On estimating the stochastic volatility\n","model from observed bilateral exchange rate news, by R. Mahieu, and P.\n","Schotman; 2) A state space approach to estimate multi-factors CIR models of the\n","term structure of interest rates, by A.L.J. Geyer, and S. Pichler; 3)\n","Risk-minimizing hedging strategies under partial observation in pricing\n","financial derivatives, by P. Fischer, E. Platen, and W. J. Runggaldier; In the\n","first problem we propose to use a recent nonlinear filtering technique based on\n","geometry to estimate the volatility time series from observed bilateral\n","exchange rates. The model used here is the stochastic volatility model. The\n","filters that we propose are known as projection filters, and a brief derivation\n","of such filters is given. The second problem is introduced in detail, and a\n","possible use of different filtering techniques is hinted at. In fact the\n","filters used for this problem in 2) and part of the literature can be\n","interpreted as projection filters and we will make some remarks on how more\n","general and possibly more suitable projection filters can be constructed. The\n","third problem is only presented shortly.\n","We present the method of moments approach to pricing barrier-type options\n","when the underlying is modelled by a general class of jump diffusions. By\n","general principles the option prices are linked to certain infinite dimensional\n","linear programming problems. Subsequently approximating those systems by finite\n","dimensional linear programming problems, upper and lower bounds for the prices\n","of such options are found. As numerical illustration we apply the method to the\n","valuation of several barrier-type options (double barrier knockout option,\n","American corridor and double no touch) under a number of different models,\n","including a case with deterministic interest rates, and compare with Monte\n","Carlo simulation results. In all cases we find tight bounds with short\n","execution times. Theoretical convergence results are also provided.\n","The main object of our study is a four dimensional Lie algebra which\n","describes the symmetry properties of a nonlinear Black-Scholes model. This\n","model implements a feedback effect which is typical for an illiquid market. The\n","structure of the Lie algebra depends on one parameter, i.e. we have to do with\n","a one-parametric family of algebras. We provide a classification of these\n","algebras using Patera--Winternitz method. Optimal systems of one-, two- and\n","three- dimensional subalgebras are described for the family of symmetry\n","algebras of the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation. The optimal systems give us\n","the possibility to describe a complete set of invariant solutions to the\n","equation.\n","We perform the Bayesian inference of a GARCH model by the Metropolis-Hastings\n","algorithm with an adaptive proposal density. The adaptive proposal density is\n","assumed to be the Student's t-distribution and the distribution parameters are\n","evaluated by using the data sampled during the simulation. We apply the method\n","for the QGARCH model which is one of asymmetric GARCH models and make empirical\n","studies for for Nikkei 225, DAX and Hang indexes. We find that autocorrelation\n","times from our method are very small, thus the method is very efficient for\n","generating uncorrelated Monte Carlo data. The results from the QGARCH model\n","show that all the three indexes show the leverage effect, i.e. the volatility\n","is high after negative observations.\n","We perform Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations for a Bayesian inference of\n","the GJR-GARCH model which is one of asymmetric GARCH models. The adaptive\n","construction scheme is used for the construction of the proposal density in the\n","Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the parameters of the proposal density are\n","determined adaptively by using the data sampled by the Markov chain Monte Carlo\n","simulation. We study the performance of the scheme with the artificial\n","GJR-GARCH data. We find that the adaptive construction scheme samples GJR-GARCH\n","parameters effectively and conclude that the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with\n","the adaptive construction scheme is an efficient method to the Bayesian\n","inference of the GJR-GARCH model.\n","A market with defaultable bonds where the bond dynamics is in a\n","Heath-Jarrow-Morton setting and the forward rates are driven by an infinite\n","number of Levy factors is considered. The setting includes rating migrations\n","driven by a Markov chain. All basic types of recovery are investigated. We\n","formulate necessary and sufficient conditions (generalized HJM conditions)\n","under which the market is arbitrage free. Connections with consistency\n","conditions are discussed.\n","We consider the performance of non-optimal hedging strategies in exponential\n","L\\'evy models. Given that both the payoff of the contingent claim and the\n","hedging strategy admit suitable integral representations, we use the Laplace\n","transform approach of Hubalek et al. (2006) to derive semi-explicit formulas\n","for the resulting mean squared hedging error in terms of the cumulant\n","generating function of the underlying L\\'evy process. In two numerical\n","examples, we apply these results to compare the efficiency of the Black-Scholes\n","hedge and the model delta to the mean-variance optimal hedge in a normal\n","inverse Gaussian and a diffusion-extended CGMY L\\'evy model.\n","A contour integral method recently proposed by Weideman [IMA J.

The underlying asset prices follow some correlated local volatility\n","diffusion processes with systematic jumps.

The numerical\n","tests show that the suggested method is fast and accurate in comparison with\n","the Monte Carlo and other methods in most cases.\n","The log-periodic power law (LPPL) is a model of asset prices during\n","endogenous bubbles. If the on-going development of a bubble is suspected, asset\n","prices can be fit numerically to the LPPL law. The best solutions can then\n","indicate whether a bubble is in progress and, if so, the bubble critical time\n","(i.e., when the bubble is expected to burst). Consequently, the LPPL model is\n","useful only if the data can be fit to the model with algorithms that are\n","accurate and computationally efficient. In this paper, we address primarily the\n","computational efficiency and secondarily the precision of the LPPL non-linear\n","least-square fit. Specifically, we present a parallel Levenberg-Marquardt\n","algorithm (LMA) for LPPL least-square fit that sped up computation of more than\n","a factor of four over a sequential LMA on historical and synthetic price\n","series. Additionally, we isolate a linear sub-structure of the LPPL\n","least-square fit that can be paired with an exact computation of the Jacobian,\n","give new settings for the Levenberg-Marquardt damping factor, and describe a\n","heuristic method to choose initial solutions.\n","The utility-based pricing of defaultable bonds in the case of stochastic\n","intensity models of default risk is discussed. The Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman\n","(HJB) equations for the value functions is derived. A finite difference method\n","is used to solve this problem. The yield-spreads for both buyer and seller are\n","extracted. The behaviour of the spread curve given the default intensity is\n","analyzed. Finally the impacts of the risk aversion and the correlation\n","coefficient are discussed.\n","Stylized facts can be regarded as constraints for any modeling attempt of\n","price dynamics on a financial market, in that an empirically reasonable model\n","has to reproduce these stylized facts at least qualitatively. The dynamics of\n","market prices is modeled on a macro-level as the result of the dynamic coupling\n","of two dynamical components. The degree of their dynamical decoupling is shown\n","to have a significant impact on the stochastic properties of return trials such\n","as the return distribution, volatility clustering, and the multifractal\n","behavior of time scales of asset returns. Particularly we observe a cross over\n","in the return distribution from a Gaussian-like to a Levy-like shape when the\n","degree of decoupling increases. In parallel, the larger the degree of\n","decoupling is the more pronounced is volatility clustering. These findings\n","suggest that the considerations of time in an economic system, in general, and\n","the coupling of constituting processes is essential for understanding the\n","behavior of a financial market.\n","We show how Adjoint Algorithmic Differentiation (AAD) allows an extremely\n","efficient calculation of correlation Risk of option prices computed with Monte\n","Carlo simulations. A key point in the construction is the use of binning to\n","simultaneously achieve computational efficiency and accurate confidence\n","intervals. We illustrate the method for a copula-based Monte Carlo computation\n","of claims written on a basket of underlying assets, and we test it numerically\n","for Portfolio Default Options. For any number of underlying assets or names in\n","a portfolio, the sensitivities of the option price with respect to all the\n","pairwise correlations is obtained at a computational cost which is at most 4\n","times the cost of calculating the option value itself. For typical\n","applications, this results in computational savings of several order of\n","magnitudes with respect to standard methods.\n","In this paper we prove that there exists a smooth classical solution to the\n","HJB equation for a large class of constrained problems with utility functions\n","that are not necessarily differentiable or strictly concave. The value function\n","is smooth if admissible controls satisfy an integrability condition or if it is\n","continuous on the closure of its domain. The key idea is to work on the dual\n","control problem and the dual HJB equation. We construct a smooth, strictly\n","convex solution to the dual HJB equation and show that its conjugate function\n","is a smooth, strictly concave solution to the primal HJB equation satisfying\n","the terminal and boundary conditions.\n","The incorporation of a dividend yield in the classical option pricing model\n","of Black- Scholes results in a minor modification of the Black-Scholes formula,\n","since the lognormal dynamic of the underlying asset is preserved. However,\n","market makers prefer to work with cash dividends with fixed value instead of a\n","dividend yield. Since there is no closed-form solution for the price of a\n","European Call in this case, many methods have been proposed in the literature\n","to approximate it. Here, we present a new approach. We derive an exact analytic\n","formula for the sensitivity to dividends of an European option. We use this\n","result to elaborate a proxy which possesses the same Taylor expansion around 0\n","with respect to the dividends as the exact price. The obtained approximation is\n","very fast to compute (the same complexity than the usual Black-Scholes formula)\n","and numerical tests show the extreme accuracy of the method for all practical\n","cases.\n","This paper deals with numerical solutions of maximizing expected utility from\n","terminal wealth under a non-bankruptcy constraint. The wealth process is\n","subject to shocks produced by a general marked point process. The problem of\n","the agent is to derive the optimal insurance strategy which allows \"lowering\"\n","the level of the shocks.

We study the\n","well-known central second-order finite difference discretization, which leads\n","to large semi-discrete systems with non-normal matrices A. By employing the\n","logarithmic spectral norm we prove practical, rigorous stability bounds. Our\n","theoretical stability results are illustrated by ample numerical experiments.\n","We introduce a new probabilistic method for solving a class of impulse\n","control problems based on their representations as Backward Stochastic\n","Differential Equations (BSDEs for short) with constrained jumps. As an example,\n","our method is used for pricing Swing options. We deal with the jump constraint\n","by a penalization procedure and apply a discrete-time backward scheme to the\n","resulting penalized BSDE with jumps. We study the convergence of this numerical\n","method, with respect to the main approximation parameters: the jump intensity\n","$\\lambda$, the penalization parameter $p > 0$ and the time step. In particular,\n","we obtain a convergence rate of the error due to penalization of order\n","$(\\lambda p)^{\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}}, \\forall \\alpha \\in \\left(0,\n","\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. Combining this approach with Monte Carlo techniques, we\n","then work out the valuation problem of (normalized) Swing options in the Black\n","and Scholes framework. We present numerical tests and compare our results with\n","a classical iteration method.\n","One of the most popular copulas for modeling dependence structures is\n","t-copula. Recently the grouped t-copula was generalized to allow each group to\n","have one member only, so that a priori grouping is not required and the\n","dependence modeling is more flexible. This paper describes a Markov chain Monte\n","Carlo (MCMC) method under the Bayesian inference framework for estimating and\n","choosing t-copula models. Using historical data of foreign exchange (FX) rates\n","as a case study, we found that Bayesian model choice criteria overwhelmingly\n","favor the generalized t-copula. In addition, all the criteria also agree on the\n","second most likely model and these inferences are all consistent with classical\n","likelihood ratio tests. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of model choice on\n","the conditional Value-at-Risk for portfolios of six major FX rates.\n","To construct a no-arbitrage defaultable bond market, we work on the state\n","price density framework. Using the heat kernel approach (HKA for short) with\n","the killing of a Markov process, we construct a single defaultable bond market\n","that enables an explicit expression of a defaultable bond and credit spread\n","under quadratic Gaussian settings. Some simulation results show that the model\n","is not only tractable but realistic.\n","We present a numerical approach for solving the free boundary problem for the\n","Black-Scholes equation for pricing American style of floating strike Asian\n","options. A fixed domain transformation of the free boundary problem into a\n","parabolic equation defined on a fixed spatial domain is performed. As a result\n","a nonlinear time-dependent term is involved in the resulting equation. Two new\n","numerical algorithms are proposed. In the first algorithm a predictor-corrector\n","scheme is used. The second one is based on the Newton method. Computational\n","experiments, confirming the accuracy of the algorithms are presented and\n","discussed.\n","In this paper, a standard PDE for the pricing of arithmetic average strike\n","Asian call option is presented. A Crank-Nicolson Implicit Method and a Higher\n","Order Compact finite difference scheme for this pricing problem is derived.\n","Both these schemes were implemented for various values of risk free rate and\n","volatility. The option prices for the same set of values of risk free rate and\n","volatility was also computed using Monte Carlo simulation. The comparative\n","results of the two numerical PDE methods shows close match with the Monte Carlo\n","results, with the Higher Order Compact scheme exhibiting a better match. To the\n","best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use the numerical PDE approach\n","for pricing Asian call options with average strike.\n","We prove limit theorems for the super-replication cost of European options in\n","a Binomial model with friction. The examples covered are markets with\n","proportional transaction costs and the illiquid markets. The dual\n","representation for the super-replication cost in these models are obtained and\n","used to prove the limit theorems. In particular, the existence of the liquidity\n","premium for the continuous time limit of the model proposed in [6] is proved.\n","Hence, this paper extends the previous convergence result of [13] to the\n","general non-Markovian case. Moreover, the special case of small transaction\n","costs yields, in the continuous limit, the $G$-expectation of Peng as earlier\n","proved by Kusuoka in [14].\n","We investigate the extension of the multilevel Monte Carlo path simulation\n","method to jump-diffusion SDEs. We consider models with finite rate activity,\n","using a jump-adapted discretisation in which the jump times are computed and\n","added to the standard uniform dis- cretisation times. The key component in\n","multilevel analysis is the calculation of an expected payoff difference between\n","a coarse path simulation and a fine path simulation with twice as many\n","timesteps. If the Poisson jump rate is constant, the jump times are the same on\n","both paths and the multilevel extension is relatively straightforward, but the\n","implementation is more complex in the case of state-dependent jump rates for\n","which the jump times naturally differ.\n","In this work we detail the application of a fast convolution algorithm\n","computing high dimensional integrals to the context of multiplicative noise\n","stochastic processes. The algorithm provides a numerical solution to the\n","problem of characterizing conditional probability density functions at\n","arbitrary time, and we applied it successfully to quadratic and piecewise\n","linear diffusion processes. The ability in reproducing statistical features of\n","financial return time series, such as thickness of the tails and scaling\n","properties, makes this processes appealing for option pricing. Since exact\n","analytical results are missing, we exploit the fast convolution as a numerical\n","method alternative to the Monte Carlo simulation both in objective and risk\n","neutral settings. In numerical sections we document how fast convolution\n","outperforms Monte Carlo both in velocity and efficiency terms.\n","Two of the most important areas in computational finance: Greeks and,\n","respectively, calibration, are based on efficient and accurate computation of a\n","large number of sensitivities. This paper gives an overview of adjoint and\n","automatic differentiation (AD), also known as algorithmic differentiation,\n","techniques to calculate these sensitivities. When compared to finite difference\n","approximation, this approach can potentially reduce the computational cost by\n","several orders of magnitude, with sensitivities accurate up to machine\n","precision. Examples and a literature survey are also provided.\n","This paper considers the single factor Heath-Jarrow-Morton model for the\n","interest rate curve with stochastic volatility. Its natural formulation,\n","described in terms of stochastic differential equations, is solved through\n","Monte Carlo simulations, that usually involve rather large computation time,\n","inefficient from a practical (financial) perspective. This model turns to be\n","Markovian in three dimensions and therefore it can be mapped into a 3D partial\n","differential equations problem. We propose an optimized numerical method to\n","solve the 3D PDE model in both low computation time and reasonable accuracy, a\n","fundamental criterion for practical purposes. The spatial and temporal\n","discretization are performed using finite-difference and Crank-Nicholson\n","schemes respectively, and the computational efficiency is largely increased\n","performing a scale analysis and using Alternating Direction Implicit schemes.\n","Several numerical considerations such as convergence criteria or computation\n","time are analyzed and discussed.\n","We extend our studies of a quantum field model defined on a lattice having\n","the dilation group as a local gauge symmetry. The model is relevant in the\n","cross-disciplinary area of econophysics. A corresponding proposal by Ilinski\n","aimed at gauge modeling in non-equilibrium pricing is realized as a numerical\n","simulation of the one-asset version. The gauge field background enforces\n","minimal arbitrage, yet allows for statistical fluctuations. The new feature\n","added to the model is an updating prescription for the simulation that drives\n","the model market into a self-organized critical state. Taking advantage of some\n","flexibility of the updating prescription, stylized features and dynamical\n","behaviors of real-world markets are reproduced in some detail.\n","In this paper, we discuss the application of quasi-Monte Carlo methods to the\n","Heston model. We base our algorithms on the Broadie-Kaya algorithm, an exact\n","simulation scheme for the Heston model. As the joint transition densities are\n","not available in closed-form, the Linear Transformation method due to Imai and\n","Tan, a popular and widely applicable method to improve the effectiveness of\n","quasi-Monte Carlo methods, cannot be employed in the context of path-dependent\n","options when the underlying price process follows the Heston model.\n","Consequently, we tailor quasi-Monte Carlo methods directly to the Heston model.\n","The contributions of the paper are threefold: We firstly show how to apply\n","quasi-Monte Carlo methods in the context of the Heston model and the SVJ model,\n","secondly that quasi-Monte Carlo methods improve on Monte Carlo methods, and\n","thirdly how to improve the effectiveness of quasi-Monte Carlo methods by using\n","bridge constructions tailored to the Heston and SVJ models. Finally, we provide\n","some extensions for computing greeks, barrier options, multidimensional and\n","multi-asset pricing, and the 3/2 model.\n","The potential approach is a general and simple method for modelling interest\n","rates, foreign exchange rates, and in principle other types of financial\n","assets.

The geometrical analysis of the time\n","series of cross-country liabilities shows that the systematic information of\n","the interbank international market is contained in a space of small dimension,\n","from which a topological characterization could be conveniently carried out.\n","Weighted and complete networks of financial linkages across countries are\n","developed, for which continuous clustering, degree centrality and closeness\n","centrality are computed. The behavior of these topological coefficients reveals\n","an important modification acting in the financial linkages in the period\n","1997-2011. Here we show that, besides the generalized clustering increase,\n","there is a persistent increment in the degree of connectivity and in the\n","closeness centrality of some countries. These countries seem to correspond to\n","critical locations where tax policies might provide opportunities to shift\n","debts. Such critical locations highlight the role that specific countries play\n","in the network structure and helps to situates the turbulent period that has\n","been characterizing the global financial system since the Summer 2007 as the\n","counterpart of a larger structural change going on for a more than one decade.\n","Finance has benefited from the Wolfram's NKS approach but it can and will\n","benefit even more in the future, and the gains from the influence may actually\n","be concentrated among practitioners who unintentionally employ those principles\n","as a group.\n","This paper derives a new semi closed-form approximation formula for pricing\n","an up-and-out barrier option under a certain type of stochastic volatility\n","model including SABR model by applying a rigorous asymptotic expansion method\n","developed by Kato, Takahashi and Yamada (2012).

This paper\n","describes a finite difference scheme for pricing a TARN option. Key steps in\n","the proposed scheme involve tracking of multiple one-dimensional finite\n","difference solutions, application of jump conditions at each cash flow exchange\n","date, and a cubic spline interpolation of results after each jump. Since a\n","finite difference scheme for TARN has significantly different features from a\n","typical finite difference scheme for options with a path independent payoff, we\n","give a step by step description on the implementation of the scheme, which is\n","not available in the literature.

A recent empirical study\n","by Guo et al.(2008) shows that the time difference between the economic and\n","recorded default dates has a significant impact on recovery rate estimates. Guo\n","et al.(2011) develop a theoretical structural firm asset value model for a firm\n","default process that embeds the distinction of these two default times. To be\n","more consistent with the practice, in this paper, we assume the market\n","participants cannot observe the firm asset value directly and developed a\n","reduced-form model to characterize the economic and recorded default times. We\n","derive the probability distribution of these two default times. The numerical\n","study on the difference between these two shows that our proposed model can\n","both capture the features and fit the empirical data.\n","This paper presents a general solution for a recent model by Keen for\n","endogenous money creation. The solution provides an analytic framework that\n","explains all significant dynamical features of Keen's model and their\n","parametric dependence, including an exact result for both the period and\n","subsidence rate of the Great Moderation. It emerges that Keen's model has just\n","two possible long term solutions: stable growth or terminal collapse. While\n","collapse can come about immediately from economies that are nonviable by virtue\n","of unsuitable parameters or initial conditions, in general the collapse is\n","preceded by an interval of exponential growth. In first approximation, the\n","duration of that exponential growth is half a period of a sinusoidal\n","oscillation. The period is determined by reciprocal of the imaginary part of\n","one root of a certain quintic polynomial. The real part of the same root\n","determines the rate of growth of the economy. The coefficients of that\n","polynomial depend in a complicated way upon the numerous parameters in the\n","problem and so, therefore, the pattern of roots. For a favorable choice of\n","parameters, the salient root is purely real. This is the circumstance that\n","admits the second possible long term solution, that of indefinite stable\n","growth, i.e. an infinite period.\n","We propose a hybrid tree-finite difference method in order to approximate the\n","Heston model.

The conditional expectation across the interval is then computed\n","exactly for each basis function.

However, in\n","general, the complex dependence structure inherent in most nontrivial\n","stochastic volatility (SV) models makes exact simulation difficult. In this\n","paper, we present a nontrivial SV model that parallels the notable Heston SV\n","model in the sense of admitting exact path simulation as studied by Broadie and\n","Kaya.

Extensions to the model including superposition of independent\n","instantaneous volatility processes are studied. Numerical results show that the\n","proposed model outperforms the Heston model and two other L\\'evy driven SV\n","models in terms of model fit to the real option data.

In the\n","case of dependent components of the random vector $(U^1, \\ldots, U^d)$ one can\n","achieve more accurate results by using Latin hypercube sampling with dependence\n","(LHSD).

Considerable efforts have been devoted to\n","pricing derivatives written on underliers governed by such processes. Many\n","issues remain, though, including the efficacy of the standard alternating\n","direction implicit (ADI) numerical methods for solving SV and LSV pricing\n","problems. In general, the amount of required computations for these methods is\n","very substantial. In this paper we address some of these issues and propose a\n","viable alternative to the standard ADI methods based on Galerkin-Ritz ideas. We\n","also discuss various approaches to solving the corresponding pricing problems\n","in a semi-analytical fashion. We use the fact that in the zero correlation case\n","some of the pricing problems can be solved analytically, and develop a\n","closed-form series expansion in powers of correlation. We perform a thorough\n","benchmarking of various numerical solutions by using analytical and\n","semi-analytical solutions derived in the paper.\n","The Lax-Hopf formula simplifies the value function of an intertemporal\n","optimization (infinite dimensional) problem associated with a convex\n","transaction-cost function which depends only on the transactions (velocities)\n","of a commodity evolution: it states that the value function is equal to the\n","marginal fonction of a finite dimensional problem with respect to durations and\n","average ransactions, much simpler to solve. The average velocity of the value\n","function on a investment temporal window is regarded as an enrichment,\n","proportional to the profit and inversely proportional to the investment\n","duration. At optimum, the Lax-Hopf formula implies that the enrichment is equal\n","to the cost of the average transaction on the investment temporal window. In\n","this study, we generalize the Lax-Hopf formula when the transaction-cost\n","function depends also on time and commodity, for reducing the infinite\n","dimensional problem to a finite dimensional problem. For that purpose, we\n","introduce the moderated ansaction-cost function which depends only on the\n","duration and on a commodity. Here again, the generalized Lax-Hopf formula\n","reduces the computation of the value function to the marginal fonction of an\n","optimization problem on durations and commodities involving the moderated\n","transaction cost function. At optimum, the enrichment of the value function is\n","still equal to the moderated transition cost-function of average transaction.\n","Pricing of high-dimensional options is a deep problem of the Theoretical\n","Financial Mathematics. In this article we present a new class of L\\'{e}vy\n","driven models of stock markets.

Numerical results show the accuracy of the\n","proposed method.\n","In the econometrics of financial time series, it is customary to take some\n","parametric model for the data, and then estimate the parameters from historical\n","data. This approach suffers from several problems. Firstly, how is estimation\n","error to be quantified, and then taken into account when making statements\n","about the future behaviour of the observed time series? Secondly, decisions may\n","be taken today committing to future actions over some quite long horizon, as in\n","the trading of derivatives; if the model is re-estimated at some intermediate\n","time, our earlier decisions would need to be revised - but the derivative has\n","already been traded at the earlier price. Thirdly, the exact form of the\n","parametric model to be used is generally taken as given at the outset; other\n","competitor models might possibly work better in some circumstances, but the\n","methodology does not allow them to be factored into the inference. What we\n","propose here is a very simple (Bayesian) alternative approach to inference and\n","action in financial econometrics which deals decisively with all these issues.\n","The key feature is that nothing is being estimated.\n","We present a design and implementation of the Thomas algorithm optimized for\n","hardware acceleration on an FPGA, the Thomas Core.

Two\n","standard generation techniques are the acceptance-rejection and inverse\n","transformation methods. An alternative approach to Monte Carlo simulation is\n","the quasi-Monte Carlo method, which uses low-discrepancy sequences, instead of\n","pseudorandom numbers, in simulation. Low-discrepancy sequences from different\n","distributions can be obtained by the inverse transformation method, just like\n","for pseudorandom numbers. In this paper, we will present an\n","acceptance-rejection algorithm for low-discrepancy sequences. We will prove a\n","convergence result, and present error bounds.

Moreover, except for internal\n","communication as in any organization, broad and effective external\n","communication of timely information related to systemic risks is a key mandate\n","of macroprudential supervisors, further stressing the importance of simple\n","representations of complex data. This paper focuses on the background and\n","theory of information visualization and visual analytics, as well as techniques\n","within these fields, as potential means for risk communication. We define the\n","task of visualization in risk communication, discuss the structure of\n","macroprudential data, and review visualization techniques applied to systemic\n","risk. We conclude that two essential, yet rare, features for supporting the\n","analysis of big data and communication of risks are analytical visualizations\n","and interactive interfaces.

While VisRisk is herein illustrated with five web-based interactive\n","visualizations of systemic risk indicators and models, the platform enables and\n","is open to the visualization of any data from the macroprudential data cube.\n","The growth of the exhange-traded fund (ETF) industry has given rise to the\n","trading of options written on ETFs and their leveraged counterparts {(LETFs)}.\n","We study the relationship between the ETF and LETF implied volatility surfaces\n","when the underlying ETF is modeled by a general class of local-stochastic\n","volatility models. A closed-form approximation for prices is derived for\n","European-style options whose payoff depends on the terminal value of the ETF\n","and/or LETF.

However, these are seldom\n","used in financial option pricing literature and practice. This paper presents\n","SMC method for pricing barrier options with continuous and discrete monitoring\n","of the barrier condition. Under the SMC method, simulated asset values rejected\n","due to barrier condition are re-sampled from asset samples that do not breach\n","the barrier condition improving the efficiency of the option price estimator;\n","while under the standard Monte Carlo many simulated asset paths can be rejected\n","by the barrier condition making it harder to estimate option price accurately.\n","We compare SMC with the standard Monte Carlo method and demonstrate that the\n","extra effort to implement SMC when compared with the standard Monte Carlo is\n","very little while improvement in price estimate can be significant. Both\n","methods result in unbiased estimators for the price converging to the true\n","value as $1/\\sqrt{M}$, where $M$ is the number of simulations (asset paths).\n","However, the variance of SMC estimator is smaller and does not grow with the\n","number of time steps when compared to the standard Monte Carlo. In this paper\n","we demonstrate that SMC can successfully be used for pricing barrier options.\n","SMC can also be used for pricing other exotic options and also for cases with\n","many underlying assets and additional stochastic factors such as stochastic\n","volatility; we provide general formulas and references.\n","This paper is a further extension of the method proposed in Itkin, 2014 as\n","applied to another set of jump-diffusion models: Inverse Normal Gaussian,\n","Hyperbolic and Meixner. To solve the corresponding PIDEs we accomplish few\n","steps. First, a second-order operator splitting on financial processes\n","(diffusion and jumps) is applied to these PIDEs. To solve the diffusion\n","equation, we use standard finite-difference methods. For the jump part, we\n","transform the jump integral into a pseudo-differential operator and construct\n","its second order approximation on a grid which supersets the grid that we used\n","for the diffusion part. The proposed schemes are unconditionally stable in time\n","and preserve positivity of the solution which is computed either via a matrix\n","exponential, or via P'ade approximation of the matrix exponent. Various\n","numerical experiments are provided to justify these results.\n","In this paper we discuss the possibility of using multilevel Monte Carlo\n","(MLMC) methods for weak approximation schemes. It turns out that by means of a\n","simple coupling between consecutive time discretisation levels, one can achieve\n","the same complexity gain as under the presence of a strong convergence. We\n","exemplify this general idea in the case of weak Euler scheme for L\\'evy driven\n","stochastic differential equations, and show that, given a weak convergence of\n","order $\\alpha\\geq 1/2,$ the complexity of the corresponding \"weak\" MLMC\n","estimate is of order $\\varepsilon^{-2}\\log ^{2}(\\varepsilon).$ The numerical\n","performance of the new \"weak\" MLMC method is illustrated by several numerical\n","examples.\n","GPU computing has become popular in computational finance and many financial\n","institutions are moving their CPU based applications to the GPU platform. Since\n","most Monte Carlo algorithms are embarrassingly parallel, they benefit greatly\n","from parallel implementations, and consequently Monte Carlo has become a focal\n","point in GPU computing. GPU speed-up examples reported in the literature often\n","involve Monte Carlo algorithms, and there are software tools commercially\n","available that help migrate Monte Carlo financial pricing models to GPU.\n","  We present a survey of Monte Carlo and randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods,\n","and discuss existing (quasi) Monte Carlo sequences in GPU libraries. We discuss\n","specific features of GPU architecture relevant for developing efficient (quasi)\n","Monte Carlo methods. We introduce a recent randomized quasi-Monte Carlo method,\n","and compare it with some of the existing implementations on GPU, when they are\n","used in pricing caplets in the LIBOR market model and mortgage backed\n","securities.\n","We consider a general one-factor short rate model, in which the instantaneous\n","interest rate is driven by a univariate diffusion with time independent drift\n","and volatility. We construct recursive formula for the coefficients of the\n","Taylor expansion of the bond price and its logarithm around $\\tau=0$, where\n","$\\tau$ is time to maturity. We provide numerical examples of convergence of the\n","partial sums of the series and compare them with the known exact values in the\n","case of Cox-Ingersoll-Ross and Dothan model.\n","There is a vast literature on numerical valuation of exotic options using\n","Monte Carlo, binomial and trinomial trees, and finite difference methods. When\n","transition density of the underlying asset or its moments are known in closed\n","form, it can be convenient and more efficient to utilize direct integration\n","methods to calculate the required option price expectations in a backward\n","time-stepping algorithm. This paper presents a simple, robust and efficient\n","algorithm that can be applied for pricing many exotic options by computing the\n","expectations using Gauss-Hermite integration quadrature applied on a cubic\n","spline interpolation. The algorithm is fully explicit but does not suffer the\n","inherent instability of the explicit finite difference counterpart. A `free'\n","bonus of the algorithm is that it already contains the function for fast and\n","accurate interpolation of multiple solutions required by many discretely\n","monitored path dependent options. For illustrations, we present examples of\n","pricing a series of American options with either Bermudan or continuous\n","exercise features, and a series of exotic path-dependent options of target\n","accumulation redemption note (TARN). Results of the new method are compared\n","with Monte Carlo and finite difference methods, including some of the most\n","advanced or best known finite difference algorithms in the literature. The\n","comparison shows that, despite its simplicity, the new method can rival with\n","some of the best finite difference algorithms in accuracy and at the same time\n","it is significantly faster. Virtually the same algorithm can be applied to\n","price other path-dependent financial contracts such as Asian options and\n","variable annuities.\n","A spin model is used for simulations of financial markets. To determine\n","return volatility in the spin financial market we use the GARCH model often\n","used for volatility estimation in empirical finance. We apply the Bayesian\n","inference performed by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to the parameter\n","estimation of the GARCH model. It is found that volatility determined by the\n","GARCH model exhibits \"volatility clustering\" also observed in the real\n","financial markets. Using volatility determined by the GARCH model we examine\n","the mixture-of-distribution hypothesis (MDH) suggested for the asset return\n","dynamics. We find that the returns standardized by volatility are approximately\n","standard normal random variables. Moreover we find that the absolute\n","standardized returns show no significant autocorrelation. These findings are\n","consistent with the view of the MDH for the return dynamics.\n","We deal with the interest rate model proposed by Schaefer and Schwartz, which\n","models the long rate and the spread, defined as the difference between the\n","short and the long rates. The approximate analytical formula for the bond\n","prices suggested by the authors requires a computation of a certain constant,\n","defined via a nonlinear equation and an integral of a solution to a system of\n","ordinary differential equations. In this paper we use perturbation methods to\n","compute this constant. Coefficients of its expansion are given in a closed form\n","and can be constructed to arbitrary order. However, our numerical results show\n","that a very good accuracy is achieved already after using a small number of\n","terms.\n","We analyze a generalized version of the Black-Scholes equation depending on a\n","parameter $a\\!\\in \\!(-\\infty,0)$. It satisfies the martingale condition and\n","coincides with the Black-Scholes equation in the limit case $a\\nearrow 0$. We\n","show that the generalized equation is exactly solvable in terms of Hermite\n","polynomials and numerically compare its solution with the solution of the\n","Black-Scholes equation.\n","In this paper we present a numerical valuation of variable annuities with\n","combined Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) and Guaranteed Minimum\n","Death Benefit (GMDB) under optimal policyholder behaviour solved as an optimal\n","stochastic control problem. This product simultaneously deals with financial\n","risk, mortality risk and human behaviour. We assume that market is complete in\n","financial risk and mortality risk is completely diversified by selling enough\n","policies and thus the annuity price can be expressed as appropriate\n","expectation. The computing engine employed to solve the optimal stochastic\n","control problem is based on a robust and efficient Gauss-Hermite quadrature\n","method with cubic spline. We present results for three different types of death\n","benefit and show that, under the optimal policyholder behaviour, adding the\n","premium for the death benefit on top of the GMWB can be problematic for\n","contracts with long maturities if the continuous fee structure is kept, which\n","is ordinarily assumed for a GMWB contract. In fact for some long maturities it\n","can be shown that the fee cannot be charged as any proportion of the account\n","value -- there is no solution to match the initial premium with the fair\n","annuity price. On the other hand, the extra fee due to adding the death benefit\n","can be charged upfront or in periodic instalment of fixed amount, and it is\n","cheaper than buying a separate life insurance.\n","We study the Heston-Cox-Ingersoll-Ross++ stochastic-local volatility model in\n","the context of foreign exchange markets and propose a Monte Carlo simulation\n","scheme which combines the full truncation Euler scheme for the stochastic\n","volatility component and the stochastic domestic and foreign short interest\n","rates with the log-Euler scheme for the exchange rate.

Under a full correlation structure and a realistic\n","set of assumptions on the so-called leverage function, we prove the strong\n","convergence of the exchange rate approximations and deduce the convergence of\n","Monte Carlo estimators for a number of vanilla and path-dependent options.\n","Then, we perform a series of numerical experiments for an autocallable barrier\n","dual currency note.\n","Much research in systemic risk is focused on default contagion. While this\n","demands an understanding of valuation, fewer articles specifically deal with\n","the existence, the uniqueness, and the computation of equilibrium prices in\n","structural models of interconnected financial systems. However, beyond\n","contagion research, these topics are also essential for risk-neutral pricing.\n","In this article, we therefore study and compare valuation algorithms in the\n","standard model of debt and equity cross-ownership which has crystallized in the\n","work of several authors over the past one and a half decades. Since known\n","algorithms have potentially infinite runtime, we develop a class of new\n","algorithms, which find exact solutions in finitely many calculation steps. A\n","simulation study for a range of financial system designs allows us to derive\n","conclusions about the efficiency of different numerical methods under different\n","system parameters.\n","We consider rate swaps which pay a fixed rate against a floating rate in\n","presence of bid-ask spread costs. Even for simple models of bid-ask spread\n","costs, there is no explicit strategy optimizing an expected function of the\n","hedging error. We here propose an efficient algorithm based on the stochastic\n","gradient method to compute an approximate optimal strategy without solving a\n","stochastic control problem. We validate our algorithm by numerical experiments.\n","We also develop several variants of the algorithm and discuss their\n","performances in terms of the numerical parameters and the liquidity cost.\n","Financial derivatives pricing aims to find the fair value of a financial\n","contract on an underlying asset. Here we consider option pricing in the partial\n","differential equations framework. The contemporary models lead to\n","one-dimensional or multidimensional parabolic problems of the\n","convection-diffusion type and generalizations thereof. An overview of various\n","operator splitting methods is presented for the efficient numerical solution of\n","these problems.\n","  Splitting schemes of the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) type are\n","discussed for multidimensional problems, e.g. given by stochastic volatility\n","(SV) models.

For American options an\n","easy-to-implement operator splitting method is described for the resulting\n","linear complementarity problems.\n","  Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the actual stability and\n","convergence of the splitting schemes. Here European and American put options\n","are considered under four asset price models: the classical Black-Scholes\n","model, the Merton jump-diffusion model, the Heston SV model, and the Bates SV\n","model with jumps.\n","Randomness and regularities in Finance are usually treated in probabilistic\n","terms. In this paper, we develop a completely different approach in using a\n","non-probabilistic framework based on the algorithmic information theory\n","initially developed by Kolmogorov (1965). We present some elements of this\n","theory and show why it is particularly relevant to Finance, and potentially to\n","other sub-fields of Economics as well. We develop a generic method to estimate\n","the Kolmogorov complexity of numeric series. This approach is based on an\n","iterative \"regularity erasing procedure\" implemented to use lossless\n","compression algorithms on financial data. Examples are provided with both\n","simulated and real-world financial time series. The contributions of this\n","article are twofold. The first one is methodological : we show that some\n","structural regularities, invisible with classical statistical tests, can be\n","detected by this algorithmic method. The second one consists in illustrations\n","on the daily Dow-Jones Index suggesting that beyond several well-known\n","regularities, hidden structure may in this index remain to be identified.\n","Recurrent tasks such as pricing, calibration and risk assessment need to be\n","executed accurately and in real-time. Simultaneously we observe an increase in\n","model sophistication on the one hand and growing demands on the quality of risk\n","management on the other. To address the resulting computational challenges, it\n","is natural to exploit the recurrent nature of these tasks. We concentrate on\n","Parametric Option Pricing (POP) and show that polynomial interpolation in the\n","parameter space promises to reduce run-times while maintaining accuracy. The\n","attractive properties of Chebyshev interpolation and its tensorized extension\n","enable us to identify criteria for (sub)exponential convergence and explicit\n","error bounds. We show that these results apply to a variety of European\n","(basket) options and affine asset models. Numerical experiments confirm our\n","findings. Exploring the potential of the method further, we empirically\n","investigate the efficiency of the Chebyshev method for multivariate and\n","path-dependent options.\n","We derive semi-analytic approximation formulae for bond and swaption prices\n","in a Black-Karasi\\'{n}ski interest rate model. Approximations are obtained\n","using a novel technique based on the Karhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve expansion. Formulas are\n","easily computable and prove to be very accurate in numerical tests. This makes\n","them useful for numerically efficient calibration of the model.\n","We illustrate how to compute local risk minimization (LRM) of call options\n","for exponential L\\'evy models. We have previously obtained a representation of\n","LRM for call options; here we transform it into a form that allows use of the\n","fast Fourier transform method suggested by Carr & Madan. In particular, we\n","consider Merton jump-diffusion models and variance gamma models as concrete\n","applications.\n","We study the finite horizon Merton portfolio optimization problem in a\n","general local-stochastic volatility setting. Using model coefficient expansion\n","techniques, we derive approximations for the both the value function and the\n","optimal investment strategy. We also analyze the `implied Sharpe ratio' and\n","derive a series approximation for this quantity. The zeroth-order approximation\n","of the value function and optimal investment strategy correspond to those\n","obtained by Merton (1969) when the risky asset follows a geometric Brownian\n","motion. The first-order correction of the value function can, for general\n","utility functions, be expressed as a differential operator acting on the\n","zeroth-order term. For power utility functions, higher order terms can also be\n","computed as a differential operator acting on the zeroth-order term. We give a\n","rigorous accuracy bound for the higher order approximations in this case in\n","pure stochastic volatility models. A number of examples are provided in order\n","to demonstrate numerically the accuracy of our approximations.\n","This paper is devoted to the application of an $l_1$ -minimisation technique\n","to construct an arbitrage-free call-option surface. We propose a\n","nononparametric approach to obtaining model-free call option surfaces that are\n","perfectly consistent with market quotes and free of static arbitrage. The\n","approach is inspired from the compressed-sensing framework that is used in\n","signal processing to deal with under-sampled signals. We address the problem of\n","fitting the call-option surface to sparse option data. To illustrate the\n","methodology, we proceed to the construction of the whole call-price surface of\n","the S\\&P500 options, taking into account the arbitrage possibilities in the\n","time direction. The resulting object is a surface free of both butterfly and\n","calendar-spread arbitrage that matches the original market points. We then move\n","on to an FX application, namely the HKD/USD call-option surface.\n","The paper studies the continuous-time dynamics of VIX with stochastic\n","volatility and jumps in VIX and volatility. Built on the general parametric\n","affine model with stochastic volatility and jump in logarithm of VIX, we derive\n","a linear relation between the stochastic volatility factor and VVIX index. We\n","detect the existence of co-jump of VIX and VVIX and put forward a double-jump\n","stochastic volatility model for VIX through its joint property with VVIX. With\n","VVIX index as a proxy for the stochastic volatility, we use MCMC method to\n","estimate the dynamics of VIX. Comparing nested models on VIX, we show the jump\n","in VIX and the volatility factor is statistically significant. The jump\n","intensity is also statedependent. We analyze the impact of jump factor on the\n","VIX dynamics.\n","In this paper, the valuation of European and path-dependent options in\n","foreign exchange (FX) markets is considered when the currency exchange rate\n","evolves according to the Heston model combined with the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross\n","dynamics for the stochastic domestic and foreign short interest rates. The\n","mixed Monte Carlo/PDE method requires that we simulate only the paths of the\n","squared volatility and the two interest rates, while an \"inner\"\n","Black-Scholes-type expectation is evaluated by means of a PDE. This can lead to\n","a substantial variance reduction and complexity improvements under certain\n","circumstances depending on the contract and the model parameters. In this work,\n","we establish the uniform boundedness of moments of the exchange rate process\n","and its approximation, and prove strong convergence in $L^p$ ($p\\geq1$) of the\n","latter. Then, we carry out a variance reduction analysis and obtain accurate\n","approximations for quantities of interest. All theoretical contributions can be\n","extended to multi-factor short rates in a straightforward manner. Finally, we\n","illustrate the efficiency of the method for the four-factor Heston-CIR model\n","through a detailed quantitative assessment.\n","In this work we are concerned with valuing optionalities associated to invest\n","or to delay investment in a project when the available information provided to\n","the manager comes from simulated data of cash flows under historical (or\n","subjective) measure in a possibly incomplete market. Our approach is suitable\n","also to incorporating subjective views from management or market experts and to\n","stochastic investment costs. It is based on the Hedged Monte Carlo strategy\n","proposed by Potters et al (2001) where options are priced simultaneously with\n","the determination of the corresponding hedging. The approach is particularly\n","well-suited to the evaluation of commodity related projects whereby the\n","availability of pricing formulae is very rare, the scenario simulations are\n","usually available only in the historical measure, and the cash flows can be\n","highly nonlinear functions of the prices.\n","This study aims to identify the leading of inflation indicators of monetary\n","policy in DRC. The results reveal that the most relevant inflation indicators\n","usually come from the monetary origin than the real sector.

The new algorithm relies on the\n","construction of a discrete multinomial tree. The crucial feature of our\n","approach is that -- in a similar spirit to the Brownian Bridge -- each random\n","path runs backward from a terminal fixed point to the initial spot price. We\n","characterize the tree in two alternative ways: in terms of the optimal grids\n","originating from the Recursive Marginal Quantization algorithm and following an\n","approach inspired by the finite difference approximation of the diffusion's\n","infinitesimal generator. We assess the reliability of the new methodology\n","comparing the performance of both approaches and benchmarking them with\n","competitor Monte Carlo methods.\n","We propose an offline-online procedure for Fourier transform based option\n","pricing. The method supports the acceleration of such essential tasks of\n","mathematical finance as model calibration, real-time pricing, and, more\n","generally, risk assessment and parameter risk estimation. We adapt the\n","empirical magic point interpolation method of Barrault, Nguyen, Maday and\n","Patera (2004) to parametric Fourier pricing. In the offline phase, a quadrature\n","rule is tailored to the family of integrands of the parametric pricing problem.\n","In the online phase, the quadrature rule then yields fast and accurate\n","approximations of the option prices. Under analyticity assumptions the pricing\n","error decays exponentially. Numerical experiments in one dimension confirm our\n","theoretical findings and show a significant gain in efficiency, even for\n","examples beyond the scope of the theoretical results.\n","This paper presents an algorithm for a complete and efficient calibration of\n","the Heston stochastic volatility model. We express the calibration as a\n","nonlinear least squares problem. We exploit a suitable representation of the\n","Heston characteristic function and modify it to avoid discontinuities caused by\n","branch switchings of complex functions. Using this representation, we obtain\n","the analytical gradient of the price of a vanilla option with respect to the\n","model parameters, which is the key element of all variants of the objective\n","function. The interdependency between the components of the gradient enables an\n","efficient implementation which is around ten times faster than a numerical\n","gradient. We choose the Levenberg-Marquardt method to calibrate the model and\n","do not observe multiple local minima reported in previous research.\n","Two-dimensional sections show that the objective function is shaped as a narrow\n","valley with a flat bottom. Our method is the fastest calibration of the Heston\n","model developed so far and meets the speed requirement of practical trading.\n","We calculate the realized volatility in the spin model of financial markets\n","and examine the returns standardized by the realized volatility. We find that\n","moments of the standardized returns agree with the theoretical values of\n","standard normal variables. This is the first evidence that the return dynamics\n","of the spin financial market is consistent with the view of the\n","mixture-of-distribution hypothesis that also holds in the real financial\n","markets.\n","In this article we consider affine generalizations of the Merton jump\n","diffusion model [Merton, J. Fin. Econ., 1976] and the respective pricing of\n","European options. On the one hand, the Brownian motion part in the Merton model\n","may be generalized to a log-Heston model, and on the other hand, the jump part\n","may be generalized to an affine process with possibly state dependent jumps.\n","While the characteristic function of the log-Heston component is known in\n","closed form, the characteristic function of the second component may be unknown\n","explicitly. For the latter component we propose an approximation procedure\n","based on the method introduced in [Belomestny et al., J. Func. Anal., 2009].

This\n","evaluation is based on an optimal observation and normalization scheme which\n","maximizes the mutual information between domestic trends and daily volatility\n","in the training set.

One of the important problem connected with market graph is\n","to identify it from observations. Traditional way for the market graph\n","identification is to use a simple procedure based on statistical estimations of\n","Pearson correlations between pairs of stocks. Recently a new class of\n","statistical procedures for the market graph identification was introduced and\n","optimality of these procedures in Pearson correlation Gaussian network was\n","proved. However the obtained procedures have a high reliability only for\n","Gaussian multivariate distributions of stocks attributes. One of the way to\n","correct this drawback is to consider a different networks generated by\n","different measures of pairwise similarity of stocks. A new and promising model\n","in this context is the sign similarity network. In the present paper the market\n","graph identification problem in sign similarity network is considered. A new\n","class of statistical procedures for the market graph identification is\n","introduced and optimality of these procedures is proved. Numerical experiments\n","detect essential difference in quality of optimal procedures in sign similarity\n","and Pearson correlation networks. In particular it is observed that the quality\n","of optimal identification procedure in sign similarity network is not sensitive\n","to the assumptions on distribution of stocks attributes.\n","We consider a structural default model in an interconnected banking network\n","as in Lipton [International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance, 19(6),\n","2016], with mutual obligations between each pair of banks. We analyse the model\n","numerically for two banks with jumps in their asset value processes.\n","Specifically, we develop a finite difference method for the resulting\n","two-dimensional partial integro-differential equation, and study its stability\n","and consistency. We then compute joint and marginal survival probabilities, as\n","well as prices of credit default swaps (CDS), first-to-default swaps (FTD),\n","credit and debt value adjustments (CVA and DVA). Finally, we calibrate the\n","model to market data and assess the impact of jump risk.\n","We present a numerical method for the frequent pricing of financial\n","derivatives that depends on a large number of variables. The method is based on\n","the construction of a polynomial basis to interpolate the value function of the\n","problem by means of a hierarchical orthogonalization process that allows to\n","reduce the number of degrees of freedom needed to have an accurate\n","representation of the value function.
